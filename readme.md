[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/davidmerfield/Blot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/davidmerfield/Blot)

I recommend waiting until I write a setup guide before attempting to run Blot on your own server. Eventually I refactor the code such that Blot can be installed quickly and simply. I will sell Blot at a reasonable price to self-hosters, with an option to pay more for support.

In the meantime, feel free to dig through the code. All the interesting stuff happens in [/app](/app).
