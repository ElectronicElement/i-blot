[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/davidmerfield/Blot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/davidmerfield/Blot)

[Blot](https://blot.im/) is a blogging platform with no interface. It creates a special folder in your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. The point of all this — the reason Blot exists — is so you can use your favorite tools to create whatever you publish.

I recommend waiting until I write a setup guide before attempting to run Blot on your own server. Eventually I refactor the code such that Blot can be installed quickly and simply. I will sell Blot at a reasonable price to self-hosters, with an option to pay more for support.
