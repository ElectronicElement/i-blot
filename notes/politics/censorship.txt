# Censorship

Blot has been running for a number of years now and already there are hundreds of posts and articles published that I find upsetting. But I would never remove them. I think free-speech is a good principle. Of course letting people speak freely sometimes causes others pain. On balance, I believe the pain is less damaging than the censorship needed to prevent it.

I don't want to have the power to prevent people from reading dumb, hateful, mean and stupid things. 

If I had a choice, I wouldn't remove anything from Blot. I am bound by the laws of the state of Washington in the USA. I will remove copyrighted material per the DMCA.

At some point in future, I suspect Blot will be blocked in China, in Russia and various other states which implement internet filtering. Perhaps some bureacrat will ask me to block or remove some content from the site. It is inevitable. 

Thankfully, Blot is open-source software dedicated to the public domain. You can host it on your own server.
