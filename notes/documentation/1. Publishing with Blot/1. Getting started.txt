ID: introduction

Blot is a handy way to run a blog. It’s suitable for static websites that are updated regularly. 

Blot creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. It will watch this folder for any changes and publishes files you put inside.

All **files in Blot's folder are public**. This means, if you add a file called ```archive.zip``` to your folder, your readers will be able to download the file at ```{{example.com}}/archive.zip```. This means that you can use Blot as a static file server.

Blot tries to convert files inside its folder into blog posts. The following types of files are converted into posts:

- **Text** .txt, .md
- **Images** .png, .jpg, .gif
- **Word documents** .docx
- **Bookmarks** .webloc
- **HTML** .html

For example, if you wanted to embed an image ```apple.jpg``` inside a blog post. You would rename the file to ```_apple.jpg```
Any other type of file inside Blot’s folder is not turned into a blog post. 

## Ignoring files

- start the file’s name with an underscore (_) e.g. _apple.jpg
- Put the file inside a folder whose name starts with an underscore
