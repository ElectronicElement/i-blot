ID: introduction

Blot is a blogging platform. It creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. These files will become blog posts:

- **Text** .txt, .md
- **Images** .png, .jpeg, .gif
- **Word documents** .docx
- **Bookmarks** .webloc
- **HTML** .html

# Public files

All files in Blot's folder are public. For example, if you put a file called ```/Orange.zip``` in your folder, your readers will be able to download the file at ```{{example.com}}/Orange.zip```. 

# Ignore a file

Blot will not turn a file into a blog post if its name starts with an underscore. This also applies to files inside a folder whose name starts with an underscore.

For example, ```/Banana.jpg``` will become a blog post but ```/_Apple.jpg``` will not. You can use this feature to embed an [image in a blog post](@embed_image).
