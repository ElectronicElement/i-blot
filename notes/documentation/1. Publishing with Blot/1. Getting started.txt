ID: introduction

Blot is a blogging platform. It creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. These files will become blog posts automatically:

- **Text** .txt, .md
- **Images** .png, .jpeg, .gif
- **Word documents** .docx
- **Bookmarks** .webloc
- **HTML** .html

All the files in Blot's folder are public. For example, if you put ```/Orange.zip``` in your folder, your readers will be able to download it at ```{{example.com}}/Orange.zip```. 

# Ignored files

Blot will not turn a file into a blog post if its name starts with an underscore, or if it's inside a folder whose name starts with an underscore. 

For example, ```/Banana.jpg``` will become a blog post but ```/_Apple.jpg``` will not. You can use this feature to embed an [image in a blog post](@embed_image).
