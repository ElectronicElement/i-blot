# Drafts

It is possible to check that a post looks just right before publishing it using the Drafts feature.

Files inside a folder called 'Drafts' are not published. Blot creates a preview for that file instead.

If you open this preview file in your web browser, you will see exactly how the post will appear on your site without actually publishing it.

When you are ready to publish your post, just move the file outside the drafts folder. Blot will remove the preview file for you.
