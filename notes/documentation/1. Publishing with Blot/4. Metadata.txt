# Metadata

Blot generates a [publish date](@date), [permalink](@urls), [thumbnail](@thumbnail) and a list of [tags](@tags) for each blog post. However, you can specify this metadata yourself:

```
Date: February 28th, 1973
Permalink: gravity

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

Metadata must start on the first line and be separated from the rest of the post by a blank line.
