# Metadata

Blot automatically generates a [publish date](@date), [permalink](@urls), [thumbnail](@thumbnail) and a list of [tags](@tags) for each blog post. However, you can specify this metadata yourself:

```
Date: February 28th, 1973
Permalink: gravity

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

Metadata must start on the fileâ€™s first line and be separated from the rest of the post with a blank line.

You can create your own [metadata](@template_metadata) and access it in your blog's [template](@template).

You can create a page elsewhere in your blog's folder by adding ```Page: yes``` to the file's [metadata](#metadata). If you'd like to create a page that isn't on your blog's menu, add ```Menu: no``` as well.
