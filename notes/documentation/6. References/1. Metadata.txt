You can create your own [metadata](@template_metadata) and access it in your blog's [template](@template).

Here is the full list of Blot's native metadata:

You can create a page elsewhere in your blog's folder by adding ```Page: yes``` to the file's [metadata](#metadata). If you'd like to create a page that isn't on your blog's menu, add ```Menu: no``` as well.

Blot tries to create a thumbnail from the largest image in a blog post. 

You can specify a different thumbnail in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file. You can use a URL or a path to a file inside Blotâ€™s folder:

```
Thumbnail: /_Photos/Apple.jpg
```
