Learn how to configure your site and access some of Blot's more advanced features.

## Using your own domain

Let's say you own the domain ```example.com``` and would like to point it to your site. First, you must decide whether you would like to use the *apex domain*, which is just ```example.com```, or a *subdomain* like ```www.example.com``` or ```blog.example.com```. 

* How to use the apex domain

  1. Go to your domain's DNS page. Create an ```ALIAS``` record which points to ```blot.im```. If you cannot create an ```ALIAS``` record, I recommend using the ```www``` subdomain then setting up a redirect from the apex domain to the subdomain.

  2. Tell Blot your domain on [the dashboard](/profile).

* How to use a subdomain

  1. Go to your domain's DNS page. This is usually where you bought the domain. Create a ```CNAME``` record  for the subdomain you'd like to use and set its value to ```blot.im```.

  2. Tell Blot your full domain, including the subdomain, on [the dashboard](/profile).
