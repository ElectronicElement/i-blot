Blot charges an annual fee. You'll be billed when you first create a site, and each year after, as long as you keep your account open. You can cancel your subscription at any time.

Your payment information does not touch Blot's servers. Blot uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to process subscription payments. Read more about [Stripe's security](https://stripe.com/help/security) on their website.

## Can I host multiple sites on Blot?

Yes, you can host as many sites as you like on Blot from the same account. Each site costs $20 a year. You can also create sites in different Dropbox accounts from the same Blot account.

## Does Blot support any alternatives to Dropbox?

Not at the moment. However, I plan to eventually add support Git, FTP, GitHub and Google Drive. Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if there's a service you'd like me to support.

## Does Blot have a bandwidth or storage limit?

No, thereâ€™s no hard bandwidth or storage limit. However, if you use more than 1TB of bandwidth + storage combined per year, I will ask you to pay enough to meet the cost of hosting your site, or help you set up Blot on your own server.

## Can Blot access all the files in my Dropbox?

No, not by default. Blot only has access to a single folder in your Dropbox. However, you can grant Blot [full access to your folder](/clients/dropbox). You should only do this if you want to move your site's folder elsewhere, or share it with other people who use Dropbox.

## Does Blot use up my Dropbox bandwidth?

No, [Dropbox's traffic limits](https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/banned-links) do not apply to Blot. This is because Blot first transfers the contents of your folder to its server before delivering it to your readers. 

## Does my subscription renew automatically?

Yes. I will email you one week before your subscription is renewed to give you time to cancel or update your billing information. I hate sneaky unwanted recurring bills as much as you do.

## Canceling your subscription

You can cancel your subscription on the [account page](/account). You can choose to disable your account immediately, or wait until the end of your current subscription period. You can also permanently [delete your account](/account/disable-account).
