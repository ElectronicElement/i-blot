# Redirects

You can set up [redirects](/settings/redirects) for missing pages on your blog. Your site’s [404 log](/settings/404s) will help you discover URLs which need redirects.

When you change the URL of a blog post, Blot will set up a redirect automatically.

You can use Regular Expressions to match multiple routes. For example, the following rule will redirect URLs starting with ```/post``` to ```/blog```:

```
\/post\/(.*)  →  /blog/$1
```
