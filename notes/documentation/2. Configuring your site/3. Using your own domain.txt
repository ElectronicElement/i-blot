## Using your own domain

Let's say you own the domain ```example.com``` and would like to point it to your site. First, you must decide whether you would like to use the *apex domain*, which is just ```example.com```, or a *subdomain* like ```www.example.com``` or ```blog.example.com```. 

* How to use a subdomain

  1. Go to your domain's DNS page. This is usually where you bought the domain. Create a ```CNAME``` record  which points to ```blot.im``` for the subdomain you'd like to use.

  2. Tell Blot your full domain, including the subdomain, on [the dashboard](/profile).

* How to use an apex domain

  1. Go to your domain's DNS page. Create an ```ALIAS``` record which points to ```blot.im```

  2. Tell Blot your domain on  [the dashboard](/profile).

If you cannot create an ALIAS record for your apex domain, use the ```www``` subdomain and redirect the apex domain.
