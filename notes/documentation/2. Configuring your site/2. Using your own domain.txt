# Using your own domain

Let's say you own the domain ```{{example.com}}``` and would like to use it.

First, you must decide whether you would like to use the *apex domain* or a *subdomain*. For example, ```{{example.com}}``` is an *apex domain*, while ```www.{{example.com}}``` and ```blog.{{example.com}}``` are *subdomains*.

I recommend using the ```www.{{example.com}}``` and redirecting the apex domain to the ```www``` subdomain.

**Using a subdomain**

1. Create a ```CNAME``` DNS record for that subdomain which points to ```blot.im```.

2. Tell Blot your full domain, including the subdomain, on [the dashboard](/profile).

**Using an apex domain**

1. Create an ```ALIAS``` DNS record which points to ```blot.im```. 

2. Tell Blot your domain on [the dashboard](/profile).

If you cannot create an ALIAS record for your apex domain, use the ```www``` subdomain and redirect the apex domain.
