## Images

Here's what the markdown looks like, note the ‘!’ before the tag.

```
![Alt text](http://example.com/image.jpg "Title")
```

Yes, first create a folder whose name starts with an underscore, e.g. '_images'. Blot will not turn any of the files inside into blog posts, but they will be public. Then put the image inside then embed the image like this:

```
![Image description](/_images/image.jpg)
```

Blot resolves relative paths based on the location of the source file, not its permalink. File paths are case-insenitive. For example, let's say your blog has this folder structure:

```folder
Posts
  _apple.png
 fruit.txt
_Images
  peach.png
```

These images all resolve correctly in ```fruit.txt```, no matter its resulting URL.

```
![Apple](_apple.png)
![Apple](/posts/_apple.png)
![Peach](../_images/peach.png)
```
