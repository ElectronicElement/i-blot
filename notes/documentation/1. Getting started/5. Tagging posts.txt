# Tags

Tags are used to associate posts by subject. Many of Blot’s templates include pages to display posts matching a given tag.

You can specify tags in the [metadata](@metadata) at the top of a file:

```
Tags: Littérature, Book reviews
```

Tags can contain whitespace and should be separated by a comma.

Tags are case-insensitive. For example, the tags ```Proust```, ```PROUST``` and ```proust``` are equivalent. However, Blot displays the case of the most recently used tag on your blog so it’s worth capitalizing tags consistently.

## Using files and folders to tag posts

You can use folders to tag posts. For example, files in a folder called ```[Literature]``` will become blog posts tagged 'Literature'. You can nest tag folders:

```[Littérature] / [Book reviews] / Lamiel.txt```
