# Metadata

Blot generates a [publish date](@date), [permalink](@urls), [thumbnail](@thumbnail) and a list of [tags](@tags) for each blog post automatically. You can override this metadata yourself:

```
Date: February 28th, 1973
Tags: Literature, Nazis

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

Metadata must start on the first line and be separated from the rest of the post by a blank line.

ID: urls

# Permalinks and URLs

You can specify an entry's permalink in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file. To create a blog post with the permalink ```example.com/apple/pie```, add this:

```
Permalink: apple/pie
```

If you don't specify a permalink, Blot will generate one automatically. You can specify the format of this permalink in [your blog's preferences](/preferences). 

ID: date

# Dates

You can specify a post's publish date in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file:

```
Date: 23/06/2012

# You and the Atomic Bomb

Considering how likely we all are to be blown to pieces...
```

Blot tries to support plenty of ways that people write dates. Each of the following date formats is supported and will produce a blog post with the same publish date:

```
23/06/2012    23.6.12    23-6-2012    2012-6-23 00:00
```

You use the file's path to specify a publish date. These will all have a publish date of midnight on February 23rd, 2016:

```
/2016/2/23/post.txt    /2016/2.23.post.txt   2016_02_23_00:00_post.txt
```

If you specify a date in the future, Blot will wait until then to publish it.

If you don’t specify a date, the file’s creation date is considered its publish date. 

If you write the numbers in your dates differently, please tell Blot on the [settings page](/settings). 

You can [hide the dates](/templates) on your site if you prefer.
