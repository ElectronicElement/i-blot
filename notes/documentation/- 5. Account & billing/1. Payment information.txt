Blot charges an annual fee. You'll be billed when you first create a site, and in yearly increments after.

You can host as many sites as you like from the same account, (and the same Dropbox folder).

# Do you store my payment information?

No, your payment information does not touch Blot's servers. Blot uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to process subscription payments. You can read more about [Stripe's security](https://stripe.com/help/security) on their website.
