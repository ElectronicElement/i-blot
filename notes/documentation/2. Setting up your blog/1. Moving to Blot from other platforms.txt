# Moving your site to Blot from elsewhere

I've written scripts to generate a folder of Markdown files from sites hosted on:
- [Tumblr](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Tumblr)
- [Wordpress](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Wordpress-and-Squarespace)
- [Jekyll](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Jekyll)
- [Squarespace](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Wordpress-and-Squarespace)

None of these scripts is yet connected to a web interface. If you [contact me](/contact), I can run them on your blog and send you the result.
