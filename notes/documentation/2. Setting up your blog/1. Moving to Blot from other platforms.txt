# Moving your site to Blot from elsewhere

I've written scripts to generate a folder of Markdown files from sites hosted on:
- Tumblr
- Wordpress
- Jekyll
- Squarespace

[These scripts](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Adavidmerfield+importer%09&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults) are not yet connected to a web interface but if you [contact me](/contact), I can run them on your blog and send you the result.
