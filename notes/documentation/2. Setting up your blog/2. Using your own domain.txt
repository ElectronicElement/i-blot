# Using your own domain

Every site hosted by Blot comes with its own subdomain. You are free to use it as long as you host your site on Blot.

Once you own your own domain, you have to decide whether you would like to use the apex domain or a subdomain for your site.

For example, xxx.com is an apex domain, and www.xxx.com or blog.xxx.com are subdomains.

## Using a subdomain

Create a ```CNAME``` record for that subdomain which points to ```blot.im```.

## Using an apex domain

Create an ```ALIAS``` record which points to ```blot.im```. 

If you cannot create an ALIAS record, then use the ```www.``` subdomain and redirect the apex domain.

Once you have created the necessary DNS record, tell Blot which domain or subdomain you are using on [the settings page](/settings).
