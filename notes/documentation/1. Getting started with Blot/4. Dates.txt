## Dates

Blot uses the fileâ€™s creation date as its publish date by default. You can specify a different date in the file's [metadata](#metadata).

Blot supports a variety of ways that people write dates. Each of the following formats produces a blog post with the same date:

```
12/06/2017    12.6.17    2017-6-12 00:00
```

You can also specify a publish date using the file's name, or its path, or a combination of both:

```
2017-06-12-00:00-Awe.txt   /2017/6/12/Awe.txt   /2017/6.12.Awe.txt   
```

If you write the numbers in your dates in different order, please tell Blot on the [settings page](/settings). If you specify a date in the future, Blot will wait until then to publish it. And if you prefer, you can [hide the dates](/settings) on your site's dashboard.
