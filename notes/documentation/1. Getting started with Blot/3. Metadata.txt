## Metadata

Blot generates metadata for each post automatically, including a [publish date]({{{dates}}}), [permalink]({{{permalinks-and-urls}}}) and a [summary]({{{teasers}}}). You can override Blot's metadata with your own.

```file
Date: February 28th, 1973
Tags: Literature, Schwarzgerät

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

Metadata must start on the file's first line and be separated from the rest of the post by a blank line.
