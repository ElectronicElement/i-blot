## Formatting your posts

Blot supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), a markup language designed for plain text files. You can add headings, lists, mathematical statements set in LaTeX, syntax highlighting to code snippets and much more.

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

Blot generates metadata for each post automatically, including a [publish date]({{{dates}}}), [permalink]({{{permalinks-and-urls}}}) and a [summary]({{{teasers}}}). You can override Blot's metadata with your own.

Metadata must start on the file's first line and be separated from the rest of the post by a blank line.
