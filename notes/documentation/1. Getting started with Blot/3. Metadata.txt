Every file in your site's folder is public. For example, if you put the file ```[] Archive.zip``` in your folder, your readers can download it at ```www.your-site.com/archive.zip```.

## Metadata

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

Blot generates metadata for each post automatically, including a [publish date]({{{dates}}}), [permalink]({{{permalinks-and-urls}}}) and a [summary]({{{teasers}}}). You can override Blot's metadata with your own.

Metadata must start on the file's first line and be separated from the rest of the post by a blank line. 

You can also create [custom metadata]({{custom-metadata}}) and access it in your site's template.
