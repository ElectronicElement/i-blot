Blot is a blogging platform. It creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. This means you can use your favorite text editor to write your blog. 

## Posts

```folder
Drafts
Pages
Posts
  Bookmark.webloc
  Document.docx
  Image.jpg
  Markdown.md
  Popcorn.gif
  Text.txt
  Webpage.html
```

These files become blog posts when you put them somewhere in your site’s folder:

- **Text** .txt, .md
- **Images** .png, .jpeg, .gif
- **Word documents** .docx
- **Bookmarks** .webloc
- **HTML** .html 

Blot skips files and folders whose name starts with an underscore. Use this feature to [embed an image in a blog post](/help/guides-and-resources). 


## Importing your posts from elsewhere

I’ve written scripts to generate a folder of files from [Tumblr](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Tumblr), [Wordpress](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Wordpress-and-Squarespace), [Jekyll](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Jekyll) and [Squarespace](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Wordpress-and-Squarespace). If you [contact me](/contact), I will run them on your site and send you the result.


## Formatting your posts

Blot supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), a markup language designed for plain text files. You can add headings, lists, mathematical statements set in LaTeX, syntax highlighting to code snippets and much more.
