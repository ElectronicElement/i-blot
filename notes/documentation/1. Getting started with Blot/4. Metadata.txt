## Metadata

Blot generates metadata for each post automatically, including a [publish date](@date), [permalink](@urls), [thumbnail](@thumbnail) and a [summary](@summary). You can override Blot's metadata with your own:

```file
Date: February 28th, 1973
Tags: Literature, Schwarzger√§t

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

Metadata must start on the file's first line and be separated from the rest of the post by a blank line. Here's the full reference for metadata Blot creates for each post on your site:

| Key | Value |
| ------------- |-------------|
| ```Date``` |  Defaults to this file's creation date. Set the post's publish date using one of the [supported formats](@dates).  |
| ```Title``` |  Defaults to the first title in this post or its file name. |
| ```Tags``` |  Empty by default. Seperate [your tags](@tags) with a comma. |
| ```Permalink``` |  Defaults to a URL-friendly version of the post's title. You can specify one here or [change your site's default permalinks](@permalinks) on the dashboard. |
| ```Summary``` |  Defaults to the first sentence of the first paragraph in the file. |
| ```Teaser``` |  Like summary but a little longer. Defaults to the first few paragraphs.  |
| ```Thumbnail``` |  Generated from the largest image in the post. You can specify a path or URL to an image. |
| ```Draft``` |  Defaults to 'No'. Anything truthy (e.g. 'Yes') will turn the post into [a draft](@drafts). |
| ```Page``` |  Defaults to 'No'. Anything truthy (e.g. 'Yes')  will turn the post into [a page](@pages) and add it to [your blog's menu](@menu). |
| ```Menu``` |  Defaults to 'Yes' if the file is a page. Anything falsy (e.g. 'No') will hide the page from your site's menu. |
