## Metadata

Blot generates a [date](@date), [permalink](@urls), [thumbnail](@thumbnail) and a [summary](@summary) for each blog post automatically. You can specify your own:

```file
Date: February 28th, 1973
Tags: Literature, Schwarzger√§t

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

Metadata must start on the first line and be separated from the rest of the post by a blank line. Here's the full list of Blot's metadata:

| Key | Value |
| ------------- |-------------|
| ```Date``` |  Use one of the [supported formats](@dates). Defaults to the file's creation date. |
| ```Title``` |  Defaults to the text of the first title in the file, or the file's name. |
| ```Tags``` |  Empty by default. Seperate your tags with a comma. |
| ```Permalink``` |  Defaults to a [slugified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug) version of the title. You can [change your site's default permalinks](@permalinks) or specify one individually. |
| ```Summary``` |  Defaults to the text of the first sentence in the file. |
| ```Teaser``` |  Like summary, but longer. Defaults to the first few paragraphs.  |
| ```Thumbnail``` |  Path or URL to an image. By default it's the largest image in the post.  |
| ```Page``` |  Defaults to 'No'.  Anything truthy (e.g. 'Yes')  will turn the file into a page and add it to your blog's menu. |
| ```Menu``` |  Only relevant to pages. Defaults to 'Yes'. Anything falsy (e.g. 'No')  will hide the page from the menu. |
| ```Draft``` |  Defaults to 'No'. Anything truthy (e.g. 'yes') will turn a post into a draft. |
