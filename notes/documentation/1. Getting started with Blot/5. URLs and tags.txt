## Permalinks and URLs

```file
Permalink: /breakfast

# Breakfast at Tiffany's

A great zircon in the diadem...
```

Blot generates a permalink for each post automatically. You can choose the general format of default permalinks on [the dashboard](/preferences). Or you can specify a permalink in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file:


## Tags

You can tag a post in the [metadata]({{metadata}}) at the top of a file. Tags can contain whitespace. Although tags are case-insensitive, itâ€™s worth capitalizing tags consistently because Blot uses the most recent case when displaying a tag on your site.

You can also use brackets in a folder's name to tag posts. For example, all the files in a folder called '[Literature]' will become blog posts tagged 'Literature'. You can nest folders:

```
[Literature] / [Book notes] / Breakfast-at-Tiffany's.txt
```


{{=[[ ]]=}}

## Teasers

```file
# Lycurgus

He was of the opinion that even in
death a statesman should benefit 
his state, that even the end of a
statesman's life should not be...

{{more}}

Nor were his calculations misguided,
because there was no state in Greece
to match Sparta for lawfulness...
```

Some of Blot's templates show a teaser for each post on the homepage, and include a link to the read full post. By default, Blot creates a teaser from the first few paragraphs in the post. You can specify the breakpoint in the file yourself:



Everything before ```{{more}}``` will be included in the teaser, and the rest will be shown on the post's page. You can also use ```<!-- more -->``` in an HTML file.
