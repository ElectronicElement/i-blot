## Pages and drafts

```folder
Drafts

  About.txt
  Contact.txt

```

Files inside a folder called ‘Pages’ are added to your site’s menu instead of the list of blog posts. You can [hide a page from your site’s menu](/help/guides-and-resources) if you prefer.

Files inside a folder called ‘Drafts’ are not published to your site. Instead, Blot creates a preview file which you can open in your web browser.

## Public files

Every file in your site’s folder is public. For example, if you put ```[] Archive.zip``` in your folder, your readers can download it at ```www.your-site.com/archive.zip```. You can [use Blot as a static file server](/help/guides-and-resources). Please note that paths and URLs on Blot are case-insensitive.
