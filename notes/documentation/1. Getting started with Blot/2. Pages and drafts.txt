Files inside a folder called 'Drafts' are not published to your site. Blot creates a preview which you can open in your browser. 

## Pages

Files inside a folder called 'Pages' are added to your [site's menu]({{menu-and-profile}}) instead of the list of posts. 

## Public files

Every file in your site's folder is public. This means you can [use Blot as a static file server](/guides/static-file). For example, if you put the file ```Archive.zip``` in your folder, your readers could download it: ```www.your-site.com/archive.zip```.
