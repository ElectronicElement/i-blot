Blot is a blogging platform. It creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. This means you can use your favorite text editor to write your blog. 

## Posts

```folder
Drafts
Pages
Posts
  Bookmark.webloc
  Document.docx
  Funny.gif
  Markdown.md
  Picture.jpg
  Text.txt
  Webpage.html
Archive.zip  
```

All of these types of files become blog posts when you put them somewhere inside your site's folder:

- **Text** .txt, .md
- **Images** .png, .jpeg, .gif
- **Word documents** .docx
- **Bookmarks** .webloc
- **HTML** .html 

Blot skips files and folders whose name starts with an underscore. Use this feature to [embed an image in a blog post](/guides). 

## Formatting your posts

Blot supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), a markup language designed for plain text files. You can add headings, lists, mathematical statements set in LaTeX, syntax highlighting to code snippets and much more.

## Importing your posts to Blot

I've written scripts to generate a folder of files from sites hosted on [Tumblr](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Tumblr), [Wordpress](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Wordpress-and-Squarespace), [Jekyll](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Jekyll) and [Squarespace](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot-importer-for-Wordpress-and-Squarespace). If you [contact me](/contact), I can run them on your site and send you the result.
