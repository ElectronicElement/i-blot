Blot is a blogging platform. It creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. Blot exists so that you can use your favorite text editor to write your blog.

## Posts

All of these files become blog posts automatically when you put them inside your site's folder:

- **Text** .txt, .md
- **Images** .png, .jpeg, .gif
- **Word documents** .docx
- **Bookmarks** .webloc
- **HTML** .html 

```folder
Essay.txt
Photo.jpg
Link.webloc
Chart.html
Document.docx
```

## Public files

Every file in your site's folder is public. This means you can use Blot as a static file server. For example, if you put the file ```archive.zip``` in your folder, your readers can download it: ```www.your-site.com/archive.zip```.

## Skipping files and folders

Blot will ignore files and folders whose name starts with an underscore. For example, ```apple.jpg``` will become a blog post but ```_cherry.jpg``` will not. You can use this feature to embed a photo in a seperate post.
