Blot is a blogging platform. It creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. Blot exists so that you can use your favorite text editor to write your blog.


## Posts

```folder
Drafts
Pages
Posts
  Bookmark.webloc
  Document.docx
  Markdown.md
  Photo.jpg
  Text.txt
  Webpage.html
Archive.zip  
```

All of these files become blog posts automatically when you put them inside your site's folder:

- **Text** .txt, .md
- **Images** .png, .jpeg, .gif
- **Word documents** .docx
- **Bookmarks** .webloc
- **HTML** .html 

Blot skips files and folders whose name starts with an underscore. You can use this feature to embed an image in a seperate post.

## Formatting your posts

Blot supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), a markup language designed for plain text files. You can add headings, lists, mathematical statements set in LaTeX, syntax highlighting to code snippets and much more.
