Blot is a blogging platform. It creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. The reason Blot exists is so that you can use your favorite text editor to write your blog. 

## Posts

```folder
Drafts
Pages
Posts
  Bookmark.webloc
  Document.docx
  Markdown.md
  Photo.jpg
  Text.txt
  Webpage.html
Archive.zip  
```

All of these types of files become blog posts when you put them inside your site's folder:

- **Text** .txt, .md
- **Images** .png, .jpeg, .gif
- **Word documents** .docx
- **Bookmarks** .webloc
- **HTML** .html 

Blot skips files and folders whose name starts with an underscore. Use this feature to [embed an image in a seperate post](/guides). 

## Public files

Every file in your site's folder is public. For example, if you put the file ```[] Archive.zip``` in your folder, your readers can download it at ```/archive.zip```. This means you can [use Blot as a static file server](/guides/static-file).
