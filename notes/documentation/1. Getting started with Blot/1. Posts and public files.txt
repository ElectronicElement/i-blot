Blot is a blogging platform. It creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. 

## Posts

These files become blog posts automatically when you put them inside your site's folder:

- **Text** .txt, .md
- **Images** .png, .jpeg, .gif
- **Word documents** .docx
- **Bookmarks** .webloc
- **HTML** .html

## Public files

All the files in your site's folder are public, even the files which turn into blog posts. This means you can use Blot as a static file server. For example, if you put the file ```abacus.zip``` in your folder, your readers can download it: ```www.your-website.com/abacus.zip```. 

## Skipping files and folders

Blot will ignore files and folders whose name starts with an underscore. ```Apple.jpg``` will become a blog post but ```_Cherry.jpg``` will not. Use this feature to embed a photo in a seperate post.
