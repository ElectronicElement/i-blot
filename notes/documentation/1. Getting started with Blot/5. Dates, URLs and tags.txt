## Dates

Blot uses the file’s creation date as its publish date by default. You can specify a different date in the file's [metadata](#metadata):

```file
Date: March 8th, 1937

# North and South

As you travel northward your eye, accustomed to...
```

Blot supports a variety of ways that people write dates. Each of the following formats produces a blog post with the same date:

```
12/06/2017    12.6.17    12-6-2017    2017-6-12 00:00
```

You can also use the file's path to specify a publish date:

```
/2017/6.12.Awe.txt   /2017/6/12/Awe.txt   2017-06-12-00:00-Awe.txt
```

If you write the numbers in your dates in different order, please tell Blot on the [settings page](/settings). If you specify a date in the future, Blot will wait until then to publish it. And if you prefer, you can [hide the dates](/templates) on your site.


## Permalinks and URLs

Blot generates a permalink for each post automatically. You can choose the general format of default permalinks on [the dashboard](/preferences). Or you can specify a permalink in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file:

```file
Permalink: /nightingale

I have heard the nightingale itself.
```


## Tags

You can tag a post in the [metadata]({{metadata}}) at the top of a file:

```file
Tags: Literature, Book notes

# Breakfast at Tiffany's

A great zircon in the diadem of American literature.
```

You can also use brackets in a folder's name to tag posts. For example, all the files in a folder called '[Literature]' will become blog posts tagged 'Literature'. You can nest folders:

```
[Literature] / [Book notes] / Breakfast-at-Tiffany's.txt
```

Tags can contain whitespace. Although tags are case-insensitive, it’s worth capitalizing tags consistently. Blot shows the most recent case when displaying a tag on your site.


## Teasers

Some of Blot's templates show a teaser for each post on the homepage, and include a link to the read full post. By default, Blot creates a teaser from the first few paragraphs in the post. You can specify the breakpoint in the file yourself:

{{=[[ ]]=}}
```file
# Lycurgus

He was of the opinion that even in death a statesman
should benefit his state, that even the end of a 
statesman's life should not be vain, but should be
classed as an effective act of virtue. After all the
wonderful things he had achieved, he felt that for...

{{more}}

Nor were his calculations misguided, because there was
no state in Greece to match Sparta for lawfulness and
fame for a very long time, since it adhered to...
```

Everything before ```{{more}}``` will be included in the teaser, and the rest will be shown on the post's page. You can also use ```<!-- more -->``` in an HTML file.
[[={{ }}=]]
