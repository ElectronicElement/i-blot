## Dates

```file
Date: February 26th, 1848

A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to...
```

Blot uses the file’s creation date as its publish date by default. You can specify a different date in the file’s [metadata](#metadata).

Blot supports a variety of ways that people write dates. The following formats produce a blog post with the same date:

```
September 18, 2017   09/18/2017
2017-09-18 00:00     9.18.2017
      
```

You can also specify a publish date using the file’s name, or its path, or a combination of both:

```
2017-07-18-00:00-Post.txt   2017/07/18/Post.txt 
2017/7.18.Post.txt          2017/7.18/Post.txt
```

If you write the numbers in your dates in different order, please tell Blot on the [settings page](/settings). If you specify a date in the future, Blot will wait until then to publish it. And if you prefer, you can [hide the dates](/settings) on your site’s dashboard.


## Tags

```file
Tags: Nabokov, Phaedra

Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. 
```

You can tag a post in the [metadata]({{metadata}}) at the top of a file. Tags can contain whitespace. 

```folder
[Book notes]
  [Fiction]
    Lolita.txt
  [Non fiction]
```

You can also use brackets in a folder’s name to tag posts inside. ```[] Lolita.txt``` will become a blog post tagged 'Book notes' and 'Fiction'. 

Tags are case-insensitive. However, it’s worth capitalizing tags consistently because Blot uses the most recent case when displaying a tag on your site.


## Permalinks and URLs

```file
Permalink: /rosetta

In the reign of the new king who was Lord of the diadems, great in glory, the stabilizer of Egypt...
```

Blot generates a permalink, or permanent URL, for each post automatically. By default, Blot uses a URL-friendly version of the post’s title. You can specify a different permalink in the post’s [metadata](#metadata).

You can also change the format of Blot’s default permalinks on [the settings page](/preferences).

If you change a post’s permalink, Blot will set up a redirect for you automatically to help prevent broken links.

## Teasers

```file
# Lycurgus

He was of the opinion that even in death a statesman should...

{{more}}

His calculations were misguided, because there was no state in...
```

Some of Blot’s templates show a teaser for each post on the homepage, and include a link to the read full post. Blot creates a teaser from the first few paragraphs in the post by default. 

You can specify the breakpoint in the file yourself. Everything before ```{{more}}``` will be included in the teaser, and the rest will be shown on the full post.
