Blot generates all metadata for each post automatically based on the file’s contents, name and location. This metadata includes a [publish date]({{{dates}}}), [permalink]({{{permalinks-and-urls}}}) and a [summary]({{{teasers}}}). You can override Blot’s metadata with your own.

Metadata must start on the file’s first line and be separated from the rest of the post by at least one blank line. 

You can also create your own [custom metadata]({{custom-metadata}}) and use it on your site’s template. View the full [list of metadata](/help/guides-and-resources).
