## Routing

When an HTTP request from one of your readers arrives at your site, Blot follows these steps to work out what to send in response. This process is known as *routing*.

1. Check your site's template to see if there is a route which matches the path. If there is, render the template and send the HTML as a response.

2. Check your site's folder to see if there is a file which matches the path. Send the file as a response if it matches.

3. Check your site's list of redirects to see if you have set one up for this path. If neither, serve an error page.

You can [read the source code](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/tree/master/app/blogs) which defines these steps for a more precise idea of how things work.
