# Pledge

Need a blog? So did I.

This one is made to last forever.

We need a good solid blog platform for ourselves, and we know our friends and colleagues need one too.

We’re not going to show ads. We’re not looking for investors. We’re going to make money the best way we know how: charging for it.

It will be everything you expect in a blog platform - simple and modern.

What is it?

Post haven is a long-term project that aims to create the world’s best blogging platform and stay that way for as long as humanly possible. We’re as sick as you are about having to move your posts and photos every time a service goes away.

What are the key goals of Posthaven?

Durable URLs forever
Straightforward, open, self-sustaining, pro-user business model
Best-in-class ease of use always

Why are you doing this?

We want to build simple, useful, usable software for people. That’s what we love to do. We’ll never sell this site. It’s not for sale. Ever. Not negotiable.

Will it be $20 a year forever?

No, it will probably end up at something like $5 a month, or $60 a year. Right now, Blot is still unfinished.

We believe fair’s fair — and we’ll always be fair.

First off, we’ll charge money. There’s no question the site will run when you know how to pay for the servers.

Then we’ll keep improving the site the way a good caretaker would tend a garden. We’ll make sure things are clean and safe, and replace things when they get worn, or when it’s ready for a renovation. Think of us as long term data custodians.

What happens if I stop paying?

Permanent URLs are a powerful idea, and it’s a feature of using Posthaven we think you should get even if you stop paying. We’ll keep the site online, but you won’t be able to edit content or add to it. If you want to renew, start paying again and your account will be restored.

When will something qualify for permanent storage? Let’s keep it simple initially: If you pay for a year’s worth of service, your content is safe and we’ll keep it online.

Can I use custom domains with Posthaven?

Yes, you’ll be able to use any domain name you have with Posthaven.

Will Posthaven support multiple sites for one user?

Most definitely — we’re thinking $5/mo per user will buy you up to 10 sites with more for a small additional fee. So don’t worry about paying $5/mo for every new site you have.

What do the blogs look like?

Here are some prominent blogs currently hosted on Posthaven:

Alexis Ohanian — Cofounder of Reddit
Sam Altman — Founder of Loopt
Y Combinator — Startup Incubator
When will Posthaven be able to do _______?

We’re trying to reimplement what took us years to do with a larger team and more resources, but now with just the two of us (Brett and Garry) and just a few months. So it’s a lot, but we can’t wait to ship it all for you.

Here’s what’s in there now:

Post by email
Post by web, with photos, music, video and documents
Private sites with passwords
Pages and links
Autopost to Facebook and Twitter
Image gallery upload and editing
Commenting with automatic anti spam
Blog following with email notifications
Multiple contributors per blog
Here’s what’s coming soonest:

Bookmarklet
HTML/CSS customization
Autopost to App.net and other services
The biggest feature that we’ll put at the end of this list but will get to in a few months is full HTML/CSS theming. It’s the most complicated feature of Posterous and we rushed it last time — so we don’t want to make that mistake again.

We’ll deploy the features and let you know as soon as they’re available. The best way to see the latest is to follow us at the Posthaven Blog .

Hi, welcome to Blot!
A blogging platform for lazy people

Hi. This is Blot. A blogging platform.

Check the blog for the latest.

Made in the USA

It’s the best blogging platform. Publish a post from your phone. Fix a web page from the back of a car. It’s elegant, powerful, and always ready.

Start from scratch or choose from a variety of included templates.


Any Content You Like

Blog articles, galleries, simple pages or complex product sheets – with Kirby you are not limited to a fixed data structure. You are in control of


Why isn’t there a free plan?
We want Cushion to live a long and healthy life, and we want to afford to work on it. That’s only possible if it can pay for itself.

# Bring your own morals

I am unconcerned with the moral quality of what you publish.  I don't have to energy to evaluate all the erotic poetry published on Blot, let alone the scatological short stories. If it's legal, it stays.

## Should I switch to Blot from another platform?

It's probably more effort than it's worth. Some of Blot's user have written some export tools for Tumblr, Wordpress and Jekyll.

## Should I use Blot or Medium?

Just use Medium. By the way, if anyone comes across anything worthwhile on that platform, please contact me. They've published 2 million articles and each one apparently frivolous.

## Will Blot make me write more?

No. Blot might make publishing a blog easier but it's not going to turn you into Cicero.

## Where does the subscription fee go?

My bank account.

## Don't suffer for your success

Most of the blogs on Blot receive around 100,000 visitors or fewer a month. The annual fee of $20 ensures that Blot is profitable. Large bursts of traffic aren't a big deal, but if you're planning to host a large publication on Blot, perhaps consider hosting yourself because...

## Blot is run by one person

That's me. If I get hit by a bus: all your blog posts are on your machine and the source code is public. I'm sure you'll manage. At this point, I just tend to the few bugs left and ensure things run smoothly.

## A hosted service

I have to wake up at 3am to fix something instead of you. If the service goes down at 3am you'll have to wake me up.


## Feature requests

I built Blot to be the blogging platform I want. I recognize it is a niche product and I'm not going to do anything retarded and raise funding or employ people. I've been on that proverbial rollercoaster before and it was silly.

This means that I only add features to the platform which I want to exist. Otherwise I won't care to implement them properly.

## Branding

As far as I'm concerned, advertising is the devil and anyone party to it should be lined up at shouted at until they past. One of my goals has been to ensure that it would difficult to tell whether or not a blog is published on Blot. Even the source code.


## The worst are full of passionate intensity

I don't *really* care about this. It's a way to host my writing which got a little out of hand. 100% passion-free guarantee. If you want passion, go public your listicle on Medium.

Tumblr is so easy to use that it’s hard to explain.
We made it really, really simple for people to make a blog and put whatever they want on it. Stories, photos, GIFs, TV shows, links, quips, dumb jokes, smart jokes, Spotify tracks, mp3s, videos, fashion, art, deep stuff. Tumblr is 236 million different blogs, filled with literally whatever.

You do this:

1. Write a blog post, take a photo. THis is the hard part.
2. Drag and drop the post or image into Blot's folder

Blot does the rest automatically:

1. Downloads the file from Dropbox
2. Converts it into a blog post. If there's text, it will typeset it.
