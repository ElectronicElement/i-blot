# Places I've robbed to make Blot

Everyone steals â€“ I try to make sure I've stolen small things from lots of places so that no particular theft is conspicuous. 

[Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) - I stole much of the copy from their terms page and privacy policy. Macej's design philosophy, if I could call it that, was also influential. If I could only steal Macej's sense of humour.

[Kirby](http://getkirby.com) - Stole some of their marketing copy. Looking back, they're likely the subliminal inspiration for Blot's logo.

[NY Times](http://nytimes.com) - Their type treatment of Georgia was ripped and used to design the default theme.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - A spiritual ancestor to Blot. A beautiful piece of software.

[Stripe](http://stripe.com) - Stole from their excellent support & documentation section when writing Blot's documentation.

[Subtraction](http://subtraction.com) - The original Blot template was massively influenced by Khoi Vinh's wonderful blog.

# Places I wish I'd seen sooner

[Second Crack](http://www.marco.org/secondcrack) The project which runs Marco Ament's wonderful blog, shares a lot of the design principles of Blot.
