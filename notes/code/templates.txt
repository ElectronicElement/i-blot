# Revisiting templates


I need to make sure Blot can render 100 pages / second.

Based on current usage, that reflects double the avg. load for 10k blogs.

the render module is currently a shitshow

each template

ENTRIES SHOULD NOT BE VIEWS
  they should not be embeddable -> use albums for similar features

LOCALS SHOULD NOT CONTAIN LOCALS
  migrate page title and page description to hard coding in template

EACH VIEW SHOULD HAVE A FULL LIST OF PARTIALS & LOCALS


add 'default' template views which templates inherit but can override?

add 'default' partials which templates inherit?

  e.g. {{view.name}} - {{blog.title}}

e.g. feed.rss, sitemap.xml, robots.txt


* / template / default

no template info stored in db

everything stored on disk?

---


template = read(...) ;

mustache.parse(template);

... fetch partials and parse them too
... extract locals from view and all partials
... load locals

mustache.render(template, view);

---

store full list of locals and paths to partials against each template path?
