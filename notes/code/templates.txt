# Revisiting templates

Templates should be copy/pastable between blogs

Installation of custom template should be as easy as

'Create folder Template:

stick files inside? indicate selected template with leading *? How does blot know which template to use? Do user templates always exist in Blog folder?

move _assets to .assets or .blot ?
  image cache cannot look up images embedded in doc files
  since they're outside the blot folder

put templates inside this folder

Rewrite Templates
 - Add way to edit a color variable, select an option etc...
 - theme should be a set of options for the color picker...
 - Migrate these currently-global settings to template level:
    date presentation
    hide/show date
    entries per page
 - Store view name should include file extension...
 - Expose errors in modules/template/update on design page.







I need to make sure Blot can render 100 pages / second.

Based on current usage, that reflects double the avg. load for 10k blogs.

the render module is currently a shitshow

each template

ENTRIES SHOULD NOT BE VIEWS
  they should not be embeddable -> use albums for similar features...

LOCALS SHOULD NOT CONTAIN LOCALS
  migrate page title and page description to hard coding in template

EACH VIEW SHOULD HAVE A FULL LIST OF PARTIALS & LOCALS


add 'default' template views which templates inherit but can override?

add 'default' partials which templates inherit?

  e.g. {{view.name}} - {{blog.title}}

e.g. feed.rss, sitemap.xml, robots.txt


* / template / default

no template info stored in db

everything stored on disk?

---


template = read(...) ;

mustache.parse(template);

... fetch partials and parse them too
... extract locals from view and all partials
... load locals

mustache.render(template, view);

---

store full list of locals and paths to partials against each template path?
