At the moment I have moved Blot to an I3 instance which has 16GB of RAM, a 500GB SSD hardrive for temporary data.

The 500GB harddrive is what Amazon calls an 'instance store'. It should not be depended on. When the instance reboots the data on it is lost, I believe.

I think it might be a good idea to use it as a cache. I should also move my EBS data to a cheaper (non-ssd) drive. Then I can use the SSD drive that comes with the i3 instance.
