I believe in free-speech.

Blot has been running for almost three years now and already there are hundreds of posts and articles published that contain ideas that disgust me. But I would never remove them.

There's a webcomic on free-speech which irritates me whenever I come across it:

Free-speech is a principle, not just a law. It's a principle I believe is good for society. Of course it will cause pain but on balance, I believe its pain is less damaging than the kosh of censorship.

From the start, Blot was designed with free-speech in mind.

That's not to say I don't believe in editing. If you run a forum about Potted Plants then it makes perfect sense to remove posts that are unrelated. But since Blot is a general-purpose platform.

I don't want to have the power to prevent people from reading dumb, hateful, mean and stupid things.

If I had a choice, I wouldn't remove anything from Blot. I believe in the marketplace of ideas.

I take a very dim view of copyright and lump it under censorship. But since I am bound by the laws of the state of Washington in the USA remove copyrighted material.

The most revolting thing I've seen in 10 years on the internet was a video of a child executing a prisoner of ISIS. I would not remove that video. The poet must not avert his eyes.

At some point, Blot will be blocked in China, in Russia and various other states which implement internet filtering. Perhaps some bureacrat will ask me to block or remove some content from the site. It is inevitable. Thankfully, Blot is open-source software dedicated to the public domain. You can host it on your own server and beat the jackbooted arseholes who want to control your thoughts.
