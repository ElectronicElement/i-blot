Multi-file posts
  Build a proper dependency tree for entries
    - this could make multi-file entries a reality?
    - could be as simple as doEach(dependents, rebuild)
    - issue with public files and image cache:
        say foo.txt embeds /public/bar.jpg and is image cached
        make change to bar.jpg, foo.txt has cached old version etc...
