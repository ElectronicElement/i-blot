------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



FEATURES FOR THE USER
---------------------

* Improve nginx error pages

* Add emails notifying user of any major account changes

* Removing date metadata should reset entry.datestamp to entry.created

- Basic video posts

- Basic audio posts

- Multi-file posts from:
  1. A folder? /Posts/(Album)/...
  2. Files with the same name but different extension (image.txt and image.jpg)
  Would I need to build a dependency tree for posts?
    - this could make multi-file entries a reality?
    - could be as simple as doEach(dependents, rebuild)
    - issue with public files and image cache:
      say foo.txt embeds /public/bar.jpg and is image cached
      make change to bar.jpg, foo.txt has cached old version etc...

- Fix issue with returning users whose subscriptions have expired
  https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?zx=tqp989l7y4yi#inbox/15b5d2dc1d9ae9e1

- Accept bitcoin subscription payments



FEATURES BEHIND THE SCENES
--------------------------

* Migrate code from require('mime') to require('mime-types') since it doesn't use a global default type. Remove the mime node module.

* Migrate code from require('../../../') to shortcuts in node_modules.

* Ensure the routing in server.js is ordered to serve requests to blogs fastest, then the dashboard, then the marketing site.

* Merge all the weird vhost lines into one glob.

- Use a string-difference algorithm to improve rename recognition?
  Something with a funny name like Jaroâ€“Winkler distance.

- Add method to pause syncing and prevent future syncs
  then use this method with the create/remove blog migration too.

- Use NGINX to send all Blot's static files

- Add hourly local redis rdb dumps

- Add script to roll back into hourly local db dumps and remote backups

- nginx fail2ban & http2


SERVER ADMIN
------------

fix bug with cron job to renew letsencrypt ssl certs

Backup s3 buckets every day? delete those older than a month?

IDEAS
-----

Download the webpage for bookmark files and try to extract title + summary

Consider using something like this with themes?
http://barbajs.org/installation.html

Consider storing blog files in s3 bucket instead of ebs?
- bandwidth to-and-from is free, no? so we'd have to transfer everything when the blog was reloaded.
- would reduce storage costs by 80% vs EBS
- how would it affect performance?

Consider accepting payments from paypal?
