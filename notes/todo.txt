Improve documentation
   that you can do 'Disqus: $ID' at entry level
   3 how-tos: link blog, magazine, website

Improve demo video
  must make sense as audio only, video only.

Multi-file posts
  Add a syntax for entire folder?
    e.g. (Image album)/...
  Files with the same name but different
  extension will also be combined
    e.g. image.jpg and image.txt, easy captions!
    e.g. image.jpg and image.webloc for easy source link?
  Build a proper dependency tree for entries
    - this could make multi-file entries a reality?
    - could be as simple as doEach(dependents, rebuild)
    - issue with public files and image cache:
        say foo.txt embeds /public/bar.jpg and is image cached
        make change to bar.jpg, foo.txt has cached old version etc...
