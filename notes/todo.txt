- [let this person](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?zx=tqp989l7y4yi#inbox/15b5d2dc1d9ae9e1) know.

Fix bug with catching dropbox file renames
- False positives are really annoying. You'll publish a new post and it won't show up on your blog because it'll be buried in the archives. Renames need to be *right* next to each other in the dropbox delta queue.
- Use a string-difference algorithm to improve rename recognition? Something with a funny name like Jaro–Winkler distance.
- This has plagued nash for the last few months so let him know when it's better

Incorporate

Public site improvements
- Experiment with new layout ideas
- Turn the gif on the contact page into a gradient that changes based on the time of day wherever I am.
- Consolidate all the urls ('/changes' -> '/updates') and set up redirects
- Log 404s on the public site to identify neccessary redirects
- Personalize the documentation for logged in users
- Make the site responsive and looks good on phones
- Add a permanent floating link to Blot's support page at the bottom right of the dashboard, like basecamp

Redesign template system to make it easy to customize and create them.
- Make templates file or folder based
- Move www/blogs/* to /blogs/{{id}}/assets ? Or maybe some obscure folder?
- Disable re-rendering for template locals
- Local template editing does not clear cache
- Use Hogan for precompiling and rendering templates?
- Let [Aurynn](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1588e3df7489b554) know when it's possible to set routes locally
- Add way to allow all entry lists to access {{#months}} sorting options just like the archives page.
- Fix [Frank](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/1527fbcf999ba0c3)'s strange template bug
- Warn users that underscore will not work for hidden pages
- Fix _ entries to true public files, tell john & other folks who depend on the menu: yes, page: no side effect
- Tell [Rodrigo](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1564a13991197f63) don't write previews for _ posts
- Add support for fetching only some properties of an entry (ideally only those that are used). prevent some properties from being fetched in some lists (html, for example in all_entries). Would be a good candidate for hgetall or hget?

Sync improvements
- Re-implement folder verification feature and make use of the local content hash computation script to verify we have the correct version of a given file
– Re-instate feature to check if a rogue sync took down the server and run sync on a seperate process
- Add method to pause syncing and prevent future syncs
then use this method with the create/remove blog migration too.
- Ensure sync script is run by less priveledged user (just access to /tmp ? /blogs/{{ID}})?

Full folder access improvements
- Try to use the same app folder when you upgrade from app folder to full site folder
- Let these people know I added support for 'full Dropbox' permission
