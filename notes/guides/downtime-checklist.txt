- if not, try 'stopping' then 'starting' the instance through AWS, which is different to a system 'reboot' and may provision new hardware for the instance

Can you reboot the instance?

Does the instance have free disk space?

Does the instance have free memory?

What do you see in the logs?

Do you see inbound network packets (is this a networking issue?) on AWS cloudwatch metrics
