# Update the version of Node

First, work out the version of node you'd like to use. I do this by visiting [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and selecting the LTS (long term support) version recommended for most users.

The rest of the guide assumes this version happens to be ```12.16.3```.

## In development

First we need to make two changes to the codebase. Update the node version in .travis.yml:

```
node_js:
  - "12.16.3"
```

And edit ```BLOT_NODE_VERSION``` in ```config/environment.sh```. Commit and push to a new branch, wait for tests to run on continuous integration server.

To get the new version of node locally, install the version of node you'd like to use:

```
nvm install 12.16.3
```

Reinstall the node modules against the new version:

```
npm ci
```

Then edit ```/etc/blot/environment.sh``` and re-source those environment variables in any open sessions. Use the new version as the default for other projects too:

```
nvm alias default 12.16.3
```

## In production

```
edit BLOT_NODE_VERSION in /etc/blot/environment.sh
```

To get the new version of node locally, install the version of node you'd like to use:

```
nvm install 12.16.3
```

Reinstall the node modules against the new version:

```
npm ci
```

Restart the production server:

```
sudo stop blot && sudo start blot
```
