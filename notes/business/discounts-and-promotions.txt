Discounts and promotions
========================

I do not plan to offer any discounts on Blot. I know that it probably makes business sense for me to run sales and offer promotions.

However, offering a temporary discount seem unfair to my existing customers who have already paid full price. I also think there's something slighly ugly about the paraphenlia associated with sales: gaudy banners in bright colors shouting about price reductions, pressuring me into a purchase with the threat that the current price will rise soon. I want Blot to be force for calm. 

I also do not give out accounts for free to anyone. 

I also leave with bad taste in my mouth when I purchase something on a website whose form contains a coupon code field, but I have no coupon code.

With all of these reasons in mind, I have decided to never discount the price of Blot for any reason whatsoever. The price on the website is the lowest price it will ever be, and everybody pays it.
