# Social Media

I do not have any accounts on any of the social media websites for Blot.

- Have as few social media accounts as possible
- Respect the time of the people who follow you
- Only post updates which pertain to Blot itself
- It's fine not to tweet for months.
- Never retweet praise, it's tacky.
- Express as few opinions as neccessary
- Proof-read all posts
- Never use emoji
- Never like user content
- Never follow other users
- Never pay for followers
- Never pay for advertising
