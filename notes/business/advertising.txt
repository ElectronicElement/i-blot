Advertising
===========

I have not ever purchased advertising for Blot and I don't plan to. It would likely make business sense to buy ads. However, I just don't like advertising. I've only ever been annoyed by it.

There are obviously relatively benign forms of advertising, like say the bulletin board you might find at your local grocer's. 

In general, though, I think the world would look better without advertising. Less ugly, quieter, calmer. So I choose not to purchase advertising.  

I also think advertising is a damaging patron. Perhaps all patronage is bad, but advertising seems particularly wicked.
