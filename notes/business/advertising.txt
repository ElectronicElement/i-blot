Advertising
===========

I do not plan to buy advertising for Blot. Although it would make business sense to buy ads, I just don't like advertising. There are obviously relatively benign forms of advertising, like say the bulletin board you might find at your local grocer. 

However, the large businesses that tend to buy advertising are risky patrons. They always impose a regime of censorship in their own interests which tend to clobber all that is against the grain. It's aesthetically compromising. I'm sincerely motivated to provide a platform for the radical and avant-garde even if it means [tolerating the profane](/notes/politics/censorship). 

In general, though, I think the world would look better without advertising. Less ugly, quieter, calmer. So I choose not to purchase advertising.
