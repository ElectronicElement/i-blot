Bandwidth and storage limits
============================

A number of popular blogging services offer unlimited bandwidth and storage. Why doesn't Blot? Mostly because bandwidth and storage have real, ongoing costs. I end up paying a few cents per gigabyte per month for data storage, and a similar cost for bandwidth. 

If Blot had a customer base in the millions, across which to spread the costs, I might feel comfortable offering unlimited data.

All in all, I don't want the typical customer to think about bandwidth and storage. Blot is comfortably profitable based on the bandwidth and storage costs of the typical customer. 

What do I want to avoid? Somebody taking advantage of 'unlimited storage' to archive petabytes of data. Somebody running a commercial operation on the back of this 'unlimited storage'. Someone who views Blot's storage and bandwidth policy as an opportunity to profit. I want to provide a useful blogging tool. Data shouldn't be a perk.

I've been running Blot for a few years now, and although some sites do indeed use orders of magnitude more resources than average, none has used resources to such an extent that I've felt the need to ask them to move to their own server.

So if you're planning to run your own website on Blot, perhaps host some videos on it, you don't have to worry about the bandwidth and storage limits.
