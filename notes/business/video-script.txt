Make a simple app which interacts with the Blot folder somehow to demonstrate that its easy to make tools for publishing with Blot.

Hello there, I've just created an account and Blot has added a folder to my Dropbox. This is that folder. Blot looks for files inside this folder and turns them into blog posts.

Here's a text file containing my first blog post on my desktop. To publish it to my blog, all I have to do is put it in Blot’s folder.

*move file*

Once Dropbox has synced the file, Blot will publish it to my blog. And there it is!

If I want to edit the blog post, all I have to do is edit the file. Blot will update the post automatically.

Blot can also publish images and it works the same way.

Lots of people use Blot for scrapbooking – it’s very simple to use!

Here’s a file which has more complicated formatting. It’s got Math equations set in LaTex, some code snippets, embedded images and videos. Blot can understand all this, so when I publish it to my blog it will display correctly. There we go!

Blot also supports HTML with javascript and CSS so you can have total control over your blog posts. Here’s a file which makes use of that.

*move file*

Blot will generate an archives page, RSS feed, sitemap, and a search engine for each blog automatically. It’s got all the features you could want from a blogging platform.

Blot also makes it easy to preview a post before publishing it to my blog. All I have to do is add draft to the file’s name and Blot will create a preview for me. Here it is.

*open file*

This is exactly how it will appear on my blog. When I’m happy, all I have to do is remove ‘draft’ from the file’s name and Blot will publish it. There it is, live on my blog!
