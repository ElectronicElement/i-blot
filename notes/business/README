Business
========

The idea that became Blot came up in conversation around the dinner table of the office of a startup I co-founded. in the spring of 2013. Blot initially was a reason to learn how to program, and then an enthusiastic side-project. Blot became a business only eventually. I take the business-side of Blot more and more seriously as time passes. But even that seriousness is less than it really ought to be. 

The startup around whose dinner table Blot was concieved went to raise tens of millions of dollars then failed.
