## Serving your blog over SSL/HTTPS

Plenty of people use [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com) to serve their blog on Blot over SSL at no additional cost. You will need your own domain.

1. Add your domain to CloudFlare
2. Point your domain on Cloudflare to Blot
3. Enable CloudFlare's flexible SSL option.

Please remember to transfer all of your other DNS records to Cloudflare. If you'd like to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, you can [configure that on Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170536-How-do-I-redirect-all-visitors-to-HTTPS-SSL-).
