Blot creates a folder in your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. These files become blog posts automatically:

<div class="files">
- **Text**.txt, .md
- **Images**.png, .jpg, .gif
- **Word docs**.docx
- **Bookmarks**.webloc
- **HTML**.html
</div>
<div style="clear:both"></div>

You can organize your blog's folder however you like.
