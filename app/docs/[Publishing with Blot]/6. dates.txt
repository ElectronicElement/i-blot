## Dates

You can specify an entry's publish date in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file. Blot supports plenty of formats. The following dates are equivalent:

```
23/06/2012    23.6.12    23-6-2012    2012-6-23 00:00
```

You can use the file's path to specify an entry's date. The entries for the following files have a publish date of midnight on February 23rd, 2016:

```
/2016/2/23/post.txt    /2016/2.23.post.txt   2016_02_23_00:00_post.txt
```

If you order your dates differently please tell Blot on the [settings page](/settings). If you [change an entry's date](#change-an-entryâ€™s-date) to some time in future, Blot will wait until then to publish it. If you want to cancel a scheduled post, just delete its file. Make sure your timezone is configured correctly on the [settings page](/settings).
