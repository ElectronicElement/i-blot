## Migrating to Blot from other platforms

I've written scripts to import blog posts from Tumblr, Wordpress, Jekyll and Squarespace. [These scripts](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Adavidmerfield+importer%09&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults) are not yet connected to a web interface but if you [contact me](/contact), I can run them on your blog. The scripts generate a folder of Markdown files.
