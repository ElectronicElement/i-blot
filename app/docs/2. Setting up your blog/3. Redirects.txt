## Redirects

You can set up [redirects](/redirects) for missing pages on your blog. The [404 log](/404s) will help you work out which pages need redirects.

You can use RegEx to match multiple routes. For example, the following redirect rule will redirect URLs starting with ```/post``` to ```/blog```:

```
\/post\/(.*)  â†’  /blog/$1
```
