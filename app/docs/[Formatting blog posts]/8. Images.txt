## Images

Here's what the markdown looks like, note the ‘!’ before the tag.

```
![alt text](http://example.com/image-url.jpg "Title")
```

Yes, first create a [public folder](/help/publishing-with-blot#public-files), e.g. '_images', put the image inside then embed the image like this:

```
![Image title](/_images/image.jpg)
```


Let's say your blog has this folder structure:

```
Blot
 ├─ Posts
 |    ├─ _apple.png
 |    └─ fruit.txt
 └─ _Assets
      └─ peach.png
```

These images all resolve correctly in ```fruit.txt```:

```
![Apple](_apple.png)
![Apple](/posts/_apple.png)
![Peach](../_assets/peach.png)
```

Notice that Blot resolves relative and absolute paths based on your folder structure. File paths are case-insenitive.
