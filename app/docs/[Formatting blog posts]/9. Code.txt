## Code snippets

Indent code with four spaces:

    var foo = “bar”;

You can also wrap ```code.snippets``` with three backticks ``` `{{x}}```. This is useful for inserting code snippets inside a paragraph.

If you have enabled the syntax highlighting app, Blot will process the snippet using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). Every Blot template comes with its own syntax highlighting theme. If you are designing a custom blog template and want to use syntax highlighting, please [add a theme](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/) to your blog’s CSS file.
