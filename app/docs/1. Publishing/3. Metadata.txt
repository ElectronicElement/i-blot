## Metadata

Blot automatically generates a [publish date](#change-an-entryâ€™s-date), [permalink](#permalinks), [thumbnail](#thumbnails) and a list of [tags](#tags) for each blog post. However, you can specify this metadata yourself:

```
Date: February 28th, 1973
Permalink: gravity

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

Metadata must start on the first line and be separated from the rest of the post with a blank line.

You can specify [custom metadata](/help/templates#metadata) and access it in your blog's [template](/help/templates).

You can create a page elsewhere in your blog's folder by adding ```Page: yes``` to the file's [metadata](#metadata). If you'd like to create a page that isn't on your blog's menu, add ```Menu: no``` as well.
