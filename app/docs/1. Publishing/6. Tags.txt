## Tags

You can specify tags in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file:

```
Tags: Literature, Book reviews
```

You can also use folders to tag posts. For example, files in a folder called ```[Literature]``` will become blog posts tagged 'Literature'. You can nest tag folders:

```[Literature] / [Book reviews] / Lamiel.txt```
