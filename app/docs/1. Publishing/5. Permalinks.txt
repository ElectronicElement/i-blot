## Permalinks

You can specify an entry's permalink in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file. For example, to create a blog post with the permalink ```example.com/raspberry```, add this:

```
Permalink: raspberry
```

Permalinks can contain slashes and accents. If you're migrating to Blot from a different platform, consider [setting up redirects](/help/setting-up-your-blog#redirects) instead.
