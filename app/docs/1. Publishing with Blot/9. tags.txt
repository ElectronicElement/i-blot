## Tags

You can specify tags in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file:

```
Tags: Literature, Stendhal, Book reviews
```

Tags are case insensitive and comma-seperated. You can also use folders to tag posts. For example, files in a folder called ```[Literature]``` will become blog posts tagged 'Literature'. You can nest multiple tag folders:

```
Blot
 └─ [Literature]
      └─ [Book reviews]
           └─ Lamiel.txt
```
