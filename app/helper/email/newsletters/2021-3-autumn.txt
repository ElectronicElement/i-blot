**New features**
- You can now share a custom template with others. If you turn on *sharing* on the template editor, you’ll recieve a private link which you can send to a friend who uses Blot. When your friend opens the link, they’ll have the option to add a copy of your template to their account.
- The [Blog template](https://blot.im/templates/blog) now comes with a few point-and-click layout options. Please note that you will need to *fork* a fresh copy of the template then open the template editor to see these options.
- Blot now stores a list of *backlinks* for each post. *Backlinks* are other posts on your blog which link to the post. The [Blog template](https://blot.im/templates/blog) now displays these, and you can add [the backlinks list](https://blot.im/templates/developers/reference#entry.backlinks) to your custom template.

**Changes**
- Updated the [developer guide](https://blot.im/templates/developers) and added an [improved reference](https://blot.im/templates/developers/reference) which lists all of the properties you can use in your template.
- You can now use part of your file’s path in the link which Blot [assigns to each post](https://blot.im/how/configure/urls#reference) by default.
- Dropbox will soon make some changes to the way its API authenticates requests from third-party services like Blot. We have updated our [Dropbox client](https://blot.im/how/sync/dropbox) to handle these changes.
- Updated the tools Blot depends upon to patch any known security vulnerabilities.

**Bugs fixed**
- The process which converts your files into blog posts is now limited in the amount of memory it can consume and the amount of time it can take. Previously, certain files triggered pathological behaviour in the converter and could consume enough of the server’s resources to make it unresponsive. This was a major flaw and it is now fixed.
- You can now reference [bibliography files](https://blot.im/how/format/citations) whose file name includes an uppercase character.
- The template renderer now properly extracts and fetches deeply nested properties in your template.
- The list of entries associated with each tag is now properly sorted chronologically.

**Mistakes**

Blot’s server has been [up and working smoothly](https://status.blot.im/) all season. We fixed the catastrophic bug with the process that converts your files into blog posts in July. Since then, wee’ve been able to provide consistent service.

**Plans for this season**

- The Google Drive client has entered testing. If you would like to test it, please reply directly to this email. It should be available for general release soon.
- Continue to improve the templates, especially the point-and-click customization options in the template editor. Thank you to [David Klein](https://diklein.com/) who has helped greatly on this.
- Release a new film showing some of Blot’s more recent features
- Add support for PayPal.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
