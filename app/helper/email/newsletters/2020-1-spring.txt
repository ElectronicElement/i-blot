**New features**
- Added option to embed comments from Commento.

**Changes**
- Increased the price for new subscribers to $4 per month. This has not affected existing customers in any way: you will always pay the price at which you signed up for Blot.
- All preview subdomains are now served over HTTPS. Previously they were served over HTTP.
- Adjusted Blot's metadata parser to only accept custom metadata keys that are both: Alphanumeric
I thought about making it alphabetic-only, but sometimes I might want to have numbers in the keys, e.g. 404: no. I can't imagine wanting punctuation in the key, though.
Contain a maximum of one space
Sometimes I do want a space in the metadata key, e.g. Hide nav: yes. It should be possible to get away with only one, though. Adds rules for the format of custom metadata keys to prevent parts of posts unexpectedly parsed as metadata. Consider the following blog post, hello.txt:  allow dashes and underscores in metadata keys:
- Made a number of changes to the algorithm which extracts a summary for each post. Image caption text is now no longer included in the summary generated for each blog post. Non-breaking spaces in HTML posts are also handled appropriately. Whitespace is better nomralized to prevent the title entering the summary.
- Switched the default format of the URLs to your blog's CSS and JS files. This means they're easier to cache
- Your redirects are now returned with an HTTP status of 301 instead of 302. A status code of 301 means the redirect is permanent, rather than 302, which should be used to indicated a temporary redirect. Thank you Dominik for reporting this issue.
- Increased the length of sessions on Blot's dashboard to 90 days. Previously, cookies expired with the browser session. If merged, this will persist cookies.
- Redesigned the dashboard and documentation, as is tradition.
- Updated Blot's dependencies to latest version, updated the interpreter used to latest stable version.

**Bugs fixed**
- Fixed bug in the appearance of one of Blot's default date formats. Previously, a post pushed at 4pm would appear as 04:00 instead of 16:00.
- Fixed issue with non-ASCII characters in files names on the git client. Why? Because by default, the git diff command returns these characters in quoted octal notation, i.e. "\nnn\nnn..."
- Fixed a series of bugs which occured when you switched from the Dropbox client to the git client. These were triggered by the difference in the handling of case-sensitivity: Dropbox is case insensitive, git is not.
- Fixed a bug which prevented pages from being included in your blog's sitemap
- Fixed a number of bugs triggered by Mustache's default character escaping for URLs. Thank you Marlin for working on this.

**Mistakes**
- 

**Plans for this season**
- Do a better job of marketing Blot. I plan to release a new demo video and release the notes I've taken
-  Since template previews are now served over HTTPS, I can embed this preview inside the template editor, making
