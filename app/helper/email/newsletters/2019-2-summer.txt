**New features**

**Changes**

**Bugs fixed**

**Mistakes**

Downtime incidents:
- It looks like one of the processes which serves blog content was stuck in a restart loop and my process manager was unable to recover. The constant restarts were draining the resources of the server and causing slow performance and dropped requests. I fixed the issue by turning the server off and on again.

Not sure what triggered the restart loop, but will work it out and fix.

**Plans for this season**

If you have any questions at all about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
