**New features**
- Added the Archive template
- Re-instated Blot's CDN and generally sped up the delivery of static files on blot
- Added an option to redirect your blot subdomain to your custom domain
- Added option to use Simple Analytics as your analytics provider

**Changes**
- Cleaned up Blot's automatic slug generator – it is now no longer possible generate a slug with a trailing dash or slash
- New customers now pay by the month instead of the year
- Drafts are now hidden from search engines.
- Updated a number of the libraries which Blot depends on to their latest version

**Bugs fixed**
- Fixed a number of bugs with Blot's thumbnail generator. Found a bug in a major globbing library in the process. You can now use case-insensitive paths as expected.
- Fixed a bug with the Dropbox client which was locking blog folders
- Fixed minor bug with Markdown parser and indentation in code snippets
- Fixed a number of typos and broken links in Blot's documentation. I wrote an integration test to verify there are no broken links which should prevent them in future.

**Mistakes**

There were two downtime incidents:
- The first happened when packets stopped flowing into Blot's server for some reason on Mar 25. There was a brief outage for a few minutes around 3:35pm UTC today. Packets were not making their way to Blot's server for some reason. They're flowing again now.

**Plans for this season**
Work on the template engine.

If you have any questions at all about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.
