**New features**
- Released a new version of the template editor with a point-and-click font-chooser and color-picker. To take advantage of this, fork one of the [latest templates](https://blot.im/settings/template) then press 'Edit'.
- Added the [Isola template](https://preview-of-isola-on-bjorn.blot.im/) to the [archived templates](https://blot.im/settings/template/archived) page. 
- You can now use [citations and external bibliography files](https://blot.im/how/guides/citations) in your markdown blog posts.
- Blot now generates thumbnails from GIF and SVG images. This improves those templates which use thumbnails on their index page, like the [Magazine](https://blot.im/templates/magazine) and [Scrapbook](https://blot.im/templates/scrapbook) templates.
- You can now specify your blog post's publish date using the [RFC3339 date format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339), which looks something like *2020-04-12T23:20:50.52Z*.
- Added new [template functions to format the updated date and created date](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/pull/279) of a particular blog post to the date format of your choosing. 

**Changes**
- Script tags are now stripped from the output of your blog's RSS feed to better conform to the [RSS specification](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html).
- « French quotes » and non-breaking spaces are now removed from your posts' permalinks.
- Images under 64 pixels in either dimension no longer become thumbnails. This prevents unsightly blurry thumbnails.
- I updated the version of the Node.js runtime and the various dependencies to patch any security leaks.
- Updated the public site and dashboard as is tradition. I also added a section to the site with some of [the notes](https://blot.im/notes) I've made as I work on Blot.

**Bugs fixed**
- Deleted template views previously did not unlink the route for that view. This bug has been fixed.

**Mistakes**

There were two downtime incidents this season, one period under ten minutes on April 8th, another under forty minutes on June 28th. Both incidents were triggered by memory issues with Blot's application server. A number of sites continued to function despite the outage, since they were built and cached.  I'm working on expanding the capacity of the application server this season. 

The major mistake I made was not planning for the deprecation of an API used by the certificate authority which providers SSL certificates for Blot. As we speak new domains might take a little while to generate.


**Plans for this season**

- I have a long list of bugs to squash. 
- I would like to continue to improve the point-and-click functionality of the template editor.
- Release more of my notes.

If you have any questions at all about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
