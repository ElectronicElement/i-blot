**Plans for this season**

I'm proud to say that [Rakhim](https://github.com/freetonik)  began working part-time with me on Blot over the last few months. Rakhim's contributions have been excellent so far and I'm looking forward to working with him in the new year.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
