Downtime:

There were two downtime incidents over winter:

- The first began after the disk attached to Blot's main server ran out of free space. I have attached a substantially larger disk and set up dedicated alerts when disk space is running low. 
- The second downtime incident occured because of overzealous monitoring and incorrect systems in place to recover from server failures.

Plans for this season:

- I'd like to take a step back and do some research on existing blogging platforms.
