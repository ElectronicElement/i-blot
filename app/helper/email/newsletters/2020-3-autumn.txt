**New features**
https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A%3E2020-06-20+

- Added a new template feature to list the contents of your folder, and entries from a specific subfolder.
- Added an index property to each entry.
- Added a way to cache files sourced directly from your blog folder.

**Changes**
- Updated the various dependencies of the application server, as is tradition.
- Updated the [public site and dashboard](http://blot.im/), as is tradition. 
- Improved the appearance of code blocks on the Magazine template

**Bugs fixed**
- When you change your email address after submitting your first payment, just before you create your account, your receipts are now sent to the new email address rather than the old one.
- Fixed a potential security vulnerability with an internal function used to determine the local path on the server
- Fixed inconsistent indentation in the text-editor for the web template editor.

**Mistakes**

There were four downtime incidents this season, the first on June 28th for around 30 minutes, the second on July 26th for around 10 minutes, the third on August 2nd for around an hour and the fourth on September 20th for around 10 minutes. All of the incidents occurred when Blot’s application server ran out of memory. I’m working on continuing to expand the memory available to the application server this season. Sorry about this.

**Plans for this season**

I didn't make as much progress as I would have liked with Blot. I was away on a couple of trips into the woods and studying Latin and Greek have taken up more of my time than I would like.

If you have any questions at all about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
