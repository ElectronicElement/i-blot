**New features**
- Added [Typeset](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Typeset) metrics to all of the fonts available on the template editor.
- Added an option on the dashboard to [switch from monthly to annual billing](https://blot.im/account/subscription/billing-interval), or vice versa.
- Added a number of template engine features, including a way to cache files sourced directly from your blog folder. You can also now list the contents of your folder, and entries from a specific subfolder based on a given path.

**Changes**
- Updated the various dependencies of the application server, as is tradition.
- Updated the [public site and dashboard](http://blot.im/), as is tradition. 
- Improved the appearance of code blocks on the [Magazine template](https://blot.im/templates/magazine).

**Bugs fixed**
- Fixed inconsistent indentation when you edit your template's source code on the web template editor.
- When you change your email address after submitting your first payment, just before you create your account, your receipts are now sent to the new email address.
- Fixed a security vulnerability with some of the code Blot uses to determine the path to a file in your folder on its server. As far as I can tell, this vulnerability was not exploited.

**Mistakes**

There were four downtime incidents this season, the first on June 28th for around 30 minutes, the second on July 26th for around 10 minutes, the third on August 2nd for around an hour and the fourth on September 20th for around 10 minutes. All of the incidents occurred when Blot’s application server ran out of memory. I’m working on continuing to expand the memory available to the application server this season. Sorry about this.

**Plans for this season**

I want to continue to improve Blot’s infrastructure to handle the increasing number of new customers. I will work on improving the templates available. The [list of bugs](https://blot.im/news) I have to fix has grown longer. 

If you have any questions at all about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
