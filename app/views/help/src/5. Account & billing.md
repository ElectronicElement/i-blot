Summary: Dropbox questions, billing information

## Does Blot store my payment information?

No, your payment information never touches Blot's servers. I use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to process subscription payments. Read more about [Stripe's security](https://stripe.com/help/security) on their website.

## Do you accept PayPal/Bitcoin/Cash?

Yes, [contact me](/contact) and we’ll sort something out.

## Does Blot support other services to sync folder syncing mechanisms, Github or BitTorrent Sync for example?

But I’ll probably work on them in this order: Git, FTP, GitHub, Google Drive. Yes, when I can get around to it.

## Does my subscription renew automatically?

Yes. I'll email you a week before your subscription is renewed to give you have time to cancel or update your billing information. I hate sneaky unwanted recurring payments as much as you do.

## How do I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel your subscription with a single click on the [account page](/account). You can choose to disable your blog immediately, or wait until the end of your current subscription period.

## Can I delete my account?

Yes. you would like to remove all of your account information from Blot's database, please contact me after you have closed your subscription and disabled your account.

## Will my Dropbox bandwidth usage be affected by my blog?

Dropbox's bandwidth cap won't affect your blog. Blog posts in your Dropbox are converted into HTML and stored on Blot's servers.

## Can Blot access all the files in my Dropbox?

No, Blot only has access to a single folder, the one which contains your blog posts.
