Summary: Create posts, pages and drafts

Blot adds a folder to your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. Blot knows how to convert these files into blog posts:

- Text files *.txt, .text, .md* are converted from [Markdown](/help/formatting-blog-posts).
- Images *.png, .jpeg, .jpg, .gif*
- Word documents *.docx*
- Bookmarks *.webloc*
- HTML *.html, .htm*

There are a few useful exceptions – these files do not become blog posts:

- [Drafts](#drafts) – Files in a folder named 'Drafts' are not published. Blot creates a preview which updates as you make changes to the draft file.
- [Public files](#public-files) – Files inside a folder whose name starts with an underscore are publicly accessible and do not become blog posts.
- [Pages](#pages) – Files in a folder named 'Pages'  appear on your blog's menu.






## The folder

Blot's folder is in ```Dropbox/Apps/Blot```. You can rename this folder if you like. It's up to you to organize the files inside. You can use subfolders to:

- [Tag an entry](#tags) – Files inside a folder called ```[Apples]``` are tagged 'Apples'.
- [Change an entry's date](#change-an-entry’s-date) – Blot looks for a date in the file's path.


You can move around the files inside Blot's folder as you wish. To delete a post, delete its file. If you can’t find a deleted file, try using [Dropbox to recover](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/296) it.






## Pages

Files in a folder called 'Pages' (or 'pages') become pages instead of blog posts. Blot adds a link to each page to [your blog's menu](/help/setting-up-your-blog#menu). You can create a page elsewhere in your blog's folder by adding this line to the top of its file:

```
Page: yes
```

 If you'd like to create a stand-alone page that isn't visible on your blog's menu, add this line as well:

```
Menu: no
```





## Drafts

Files inside a folder called 'Drafts' (or 'drafts') are not published. Blot instead creates a preview file. To publish the post, move the file elsewhere in your blog's folder.






## Public files

Files and folders whose name starts with an underscore (e.g. '_photos') are publicly accessible and not converted into blog posts. This feature is useful for embedding [images inside posts](/help/formatting-blog-posts#9-can-i-put-images-in-my-folder-to-use-inside-a-post) or serving static files.

Let's say your blog has this folder structure:

```
Blot
 ├─ Posts
 |    ├─ _apple.png
 |    └─ fruit.html
 └─ _Assets
      └─ peach.png
```

These images all resolve correctly in ```fruit.html```:

```
<img src="_apple.png">
<img src="/posts/_apple.png">
<img src="../_assets/peach.png">
```

Notice that Blot resolves relative and absolute paths based on your folder structure. File paths are case-insenitive.







## Metadata

Blot generates the following metadata for each blog post:

- [Date](#change-an-entry’s-date)
- [Tags](#tags)
- [Permalink](#permalinks)
- [Thumbnail](#thumbnails)
- [Page](#pages) and [Menu](#pages)

You can override this metadata at the top of your file:

---

```
Permalink: gravity
Date: February 28th, 1973

# Gravity's Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.
```

---

You can specify [custom metadata](/help/templates#metadata) and use it in your blog's [template](/help/templates). Metadata must start on the file's first line and be seperated from the rest of your blog post with a blank line.






## Change an entry's date

You can specify an entry's publish date in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file:

```
Date: June 23rd 2012
```

Blot supports plenty of formats. The following dates are equivalent:

```
23/06/2012    23.6.12    23-6-2012    2012-6-23 00:00
```

You can use the file's path to specify an entry's date. The entries for the following files have a publish date of midnight on February 23rd, 2016:

```
/2016/2/23/post.txt    /2016/2.23.post.txt   2016_02_23_00:00_post.txt
```

If you order your dates differently please tell Blot on the [settings page](/settings).






## Scheduled posts

If you [change an entry's date](#change-an-entry’s-date) to some time in future, Blot will wait until then to publish it. If you want to cancel a scheduled post, just delete its file. Make sure your timezone is configured correctly on the [settings page](/settings).






## Permalinks

You can specify an entry's permalink in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file. For example, to create a blog post at ```example.com/raspberry```, add this:

```
Permalink: raspberry
```

Permalinks can contain slashes and accents. If you're migrating to Blot from a different platform, consider [setting up redirects](/help/setting-up-your-blog#redirects) instead.






## Tags

You can specify tags in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file:

```
Tags: Literature, Stendhal, Book reviews
```

Tags are case insensitive and comma-seperated. You can also use folders to tag posts. For example, files in a folder called ```[Literature]``` will become blog posts tagged 'Literature'. You can nest multiple tag folders:

```
Blot
 └─ [Literature]
      └─ [Book reviews]
           └─ Lamiel.txt
```





## Thumbnails

Blot attempts to generate a thumbnail for each blog post. By default, Blot will use the largest JPEG or PNG image in your blog post. You can override this and specify a path or URL to an image in the [metadata](#metadata) at the top of a file. If you use a path, make sure the image is inside Blot's folder.

If your blog post has no image, then your blog post will not have a thumbnail. Learn how to use these [thumbnails in your template](/help/templates#thumbnails).
