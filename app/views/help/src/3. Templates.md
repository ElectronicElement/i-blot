Summary: Use your own template for your blog

<style type="text/css">
  table {width: 100%}
</style>

Creating a template, or modifying an existing template will require an understanding of HTML, CSS and basic templating using [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/). Blot will be very familiar if you’ve worked with templates on other platforms.

## Modify an existing template

To modify an existing template, create a new template on the [design page](/design#create-a-template) and specify the template you wish to clone from. This will copy of the existing template that you can edit.

## Blog variables

When you’re getting started I recommend cloning a template and looking through its source to familiarize yourself with how templates on Blot work.

{{=[[ ]]=}}


| The tag…        | is replaced with…           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| ```{{name}}``` | your name |
|  ```{{handle}}```  | your blog's username      |
| ```{{title}}``` | your blog's title  |
| ```{{avatar}}```    | the URL to your blog's avatar |
| ```{{roundAvatar}}``` | ```true``` if you've indicated your avatar is round, ```false``` if not |
| ```{{cacheID}}```   | a timestamp representing the last time your blog's template was changed |
| ```{{hideDates}}``` | ```true``` if you've chosen to hide the dates on your blog, ```false``` if not  |
| ```{{blogURL}}```   | the URL to your blog's homepage  |
| ```{{feedURL}}```   | the URL to your blog's RSS feed   |
| ```{{cssURL}}```   | the URL to your blog's CSS file  |
| ```{{scriptURL}}``` | the URL to your blog's JS file  |
| ```{{sitemapURL}}```| the URL to your blog's sitemap  |

## Entry variables

Note that some of the variables, like ```{{{html}}}``` have three  handlebars rather than two. This is because Mustache escapes variables by default, and three handlebars overrides this.

| The tag…        | is replaced with…           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| ```{{id}}```      |  Number representing the entry's unique ID |
| ```{{date}}```    |  Human readable publish date for the entry |
| ```{{title}}```   |  Title of the entry |
| ```{{{titleTag}}}```   |  HTML of the entry's title |
| ```{{{html}}}```  |  HTML of the entry, including the title|
| ```{{{body}}}```   |  HTML of the entry, excluding the title |
| ```{{{teaser}}}```   |  HTML of the first few items in the entry, including title  |
| ```{{{teaserBody}}}```   |  HTML of the first few items in the entry, excluding title  |
| ```{{summary}}```   |  Text summary of the entry |
| ```{{more}}``` |  Boolean indicating whether ```teaser``` differs from ```html```. This is useful for determining whether or not to show 'read more' links. |
| ```{{tags}}```    |  List of tags for the entry |
| ```{{url}}```     |  Relative URL to the entry |
| ```{{menu}}```    |  "true" if the entry is a page, "false" if not |
| ```{{created}}``` |  Timestamp |
| ```{{updated}}``` |  Timestamp |


## Inspecting the view

If you append the query string ?json=true to a URL on Blot, you can retrieve the view used to render its template. I’d suggest using a browser extension like to make more sense of it.

## Robots.txt

You can control what search engines index by editing robots.txt. However, this view is overriden by Blot if you use a custom domain. Blot does this to prevent a duplicate content penalty.

## Embedding entries in a template

You can embed a blog post in your template using this syntax:

```
{​{> /pages/home.txt}​}
```

Please note: the path to the entry is case-insensitive but must be absolute with your blog’s folder as the root directory.

## Thumbnails

 Blot generates four sizes of thumbnails:

- **small** which has a width and height under 160px.
- **medium** the default, which has a width under 640px.
- **large** which has a width and height under 1060px.
- **square** which has a width and height of 160px.

Blot will not increase the size of smaller images. The JSON added to each entry looks something like this:

```javascript
{
    ...
    thumbnail: {
        small: {url: "...", width: 160, height: 103},
        medium: {url: "...", width: 640, height: 411},
        large: {url: "...", width: 1060, height: 681},
        square: {url: "...", width: 160, height: 160 }
    },
    ...
}
```

You can use them in your template like this:

```
{{#thumbnail.medium}}
    <img src="{{url}}" width="{{width}}" height="{{height}}">
{{/thumbnail.medium}}
```

## Custom metadata

You can specify custom entry metadata:

```
Author: Eric Blair
```

Use custom metadata in your template like this:


```
Posted by {{metadata.author}}
```

Metadata keys are case insensitive. I’d recommend using conditional blocks to prevent your layout breaking if you don’t consistently specify metadata:

```
{{#metadata.author}}
  Posted by {{metadata.author}}
{{/metadata.author}}

{{^metadata.author}}
  Posted by the editor
{{/metadata.author}}
```
