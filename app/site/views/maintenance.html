<h1>Maintenance</h1>

<p>Terribly sorry for the interruption. I'm making changes to Blot's server which mean I need to place the database in a read-only state.</p>

<p>Your readers can still access your blog but any changes you make will be applied once the maintenance is complete.</p>

<p>Please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> with any questions.</p>
