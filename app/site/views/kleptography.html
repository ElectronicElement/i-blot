<h1>Kleptography</h1>

<p>I stole little bits here and there from all kinds of places to make Blot. Those burglaries are preserved here for future reference, just in case I ever dare think I had an original idea. </p>

<p>Stole much of the copy from their terms page and privacy policy. Macej’s design ‘philosophy’ was also influential. If I could only steal his sense of humour.</p>
<br>

<a href="http://getkirby.com">Kirby</a> 
<p>Stole some of their marketing copy. Looking back, they’re likely the subliminal inspiration for Blot’s logo.</p>
<br>

<a href="http://nytimes.com">New York Times</a>
<p>Their type treatment of Georgia was ripped and used to design the default theme.</p>

<p>I think they do some really interesting, thoughtful work. I'm incredibly jealous, in fact. Stolen from their selection of themes to help make Blot’s.</p>

<p>A spiritual ancestor to Blot. A beautiful piece of software.</p>

<a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>
<p>Stole from their excellent support &amp; documentation section when writing Blot’s documentation.</p>

<p> The original Blot template was basically lifted from Khoi Vinh’s blog.</p>
<br>

<p>The project which runs Marco Ament’s blog, shares a lot of the design principles of Blot. I didn’t see this until after opening Blot to the public and I wish I’d seen it sooner.</p>

<p>I can't find good examples of individual things I've stolen but I really like the work of <a href="https://cargocollective.com/tracyma">Tracy Ma</a>, <a href="">David Rudnick</a>, <a href="">Ben Barry</a>, <a href="">Jessica Svendsen</a>, <a href="">Rafaël Rozendaal</a>, <a href="">Peter Mendelsund</a>.

<p>As I often say: the bees pillage the flowers here and there but they make honey of them which is all their own.</p>
