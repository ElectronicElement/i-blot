<p>Blot is a blogging platform. It creates a folder inside your Dropbox and publishes files you put inside. The reason Blot exists is so that you can use your favorite text editor to write your blog.</p>
<h2 id="posts">Posts</h2>
<pre class="folder"><code>Drafts
Pages
Posts
  Bookmark.webloc
  Document.docx
  Markdown.md
  Photo.jpg
  Text.txt
  Webpage.html
Archive.zip  </code></pre>
<p>All of these types of files become blog posts when you put them inside your site’s folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text</strong> .txt, .md</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong> .png, .jpeg, .gif</li>
<li><strong>Word documents</strong> .docx</li>
<li><strong>Bookmarks</strong> .webloc</li>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> .html</li>
</ul>
<p>Blot skips files and folders whose name starts with an underscore. Use this feature to <a href="/guides">embed an image in a seperate post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="public-files">Public files</h2>
<p>Every file in your site’s folder is public. This means you can <a href="/guides/static-file">use Blot as a static file server</a>. For example, if you put the file <code>Archive.zip</code> in your folder, your readers could download it: <code>www.your-site.com/archive.zip</code>.</p>
<h2 id="formatting-your-posts">Formatting your posts</h2>
<p>Blot supports <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, a markup language designed for plain text files. You can add headings, lists, mathematical statements set in LaTeX, syntax highlighting to code snippets and much more.</p>

<h2 id="drafts">Drafts</h2>
<pre class="folder"><code>Drafts
  Anecdote.txt
  Anecdote.txt.html
Pages
  About.txt
  Contact.txt
  Resources.txt
Posts
Archive.zip</code></pre>
<p>Files inside a folder called ‘Drafts’ are not published to your site. Instead, Blot creates a preview file which you can open in your web browser.</p>
<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
<p>Files inside a folder called ‘Pages’ are added to your <a href="%7B%7Bmenu-and-profile%7D%7D">site’s menu</a> instead of the list of posts.</p>
<h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>
<pre class="file"><code>Date: February 28th, 1973
Tags: Literature, Schwarzgerät

# Gravity&#39;s Rainbow

A screaming comes across the sky.</code></pre>
<p>Blot generates metadata for each post automatically, including a <a href="%7B%7B%7Bdates%7D%7D%7D">publish date</a>, <a href="%7B%7B%7Bpermalinks-and-urls%7D%7D%7D">permalink</a> and a <a href="%7B%7B%7Bteasers%7D%7D%7D">summary</a>. You can override Blot’s metadata with your own.</p>
<p>Metadata must start on the file’s first line and be separated from the rest of the post by a blank line.</p>
<p><a class="butt" href="/guides">View the metadata reference →</a></p>
<h2 id="dates">Dates</h2>
<p>Blot uses the file’s creation date as its publish date by default. You can specify a different date in the file’s <a href="#metadata">metadata</a>.</p>
<p>Blot supports a variety of ways that people write dates. Each of the following formats produces a blog post with the same date:</p>
<pre><code>12/06/2017    12.6.17    2017-6-12 00:00</code></pre>
<p>You can also specify a publish date using the file’s name, or its path, or a combination of both:</p>
<pre><code>2017-06-12-00:00-Awe.txt   /2017/6/12/Awe.txt   /2017/6.12.Awe.txt   </code></pre>
<p>If you write the numbers in your dates in different order, please tell Blot on the <a href="/settings">settings page</a>. If you specify a date in the future, Blot will wait until then to publish it. And if you prefer, you can <a href="/templates">hide the dates</a> on your site.</p>
<h2 id="permalinks-and-urls">Permalinks and URLs</h2>
<pre class="file"><code>Permalink: /breakfast

# Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s

A great zircon in the diadem...</code></pre>
<p>Blot generates a permalink for each post automatically. You can choose the general format of default permalinks on <a href="/preferences">the dashboard</a>. Or you can specify a permalink in the <a href="#metadata">metadata</a> at the top of a file:</p>
<h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>
<p>You can tag a post in the <a href="%7B%7Bmetadata%7D%7D">metadata</a> at the top of a file. Tags can contain whitespace. Although tags are case-insensitive, it’s worth capitalizing tags consistently. Blot shows the most recent case when displaying a tag on your site.</p>
<p>You can also use brackets in a folder’s name to tag posts. For example, all the files in a folder called ‘[Literature]’ will become blog posts tagged ‘Literature’. You can nest folders:</p>
<pre><code>[Literature] / [Book notes] / Breakfast-at-Tiffany&#39;s.txt</code></pre>
<p>{{=[[ ]]=}}</p>
<h2 id="teasers">Teasers</h2>
<pre class="file"><code># Lycurgus

He was of the opinion that even in
death a statesman should benefit his
state, that even the end of a statesman&#39;s
life should not be vain...

{{more}}

Nor were his calculations misguided,
because there was no state in Greece to
match Sparta for lawfulness and fame...</code></pre>
<p>Some of Blot’s templates show a teaser for each post on the homepage, and include a link to the read full post. By default, Blot creates a teaser from the first few paragraphs in the post. You can specify the breakpoint in the file yourself:</p>
<p>Everything before <code>{{more}}</code> will be included in the teaser, and the rest will be shown on the post’s page. You can also use <code>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</code> in an HTML file. [[={{ }}=]]</p>
