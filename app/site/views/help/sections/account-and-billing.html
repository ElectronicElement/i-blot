<h2 id="does-blot-store-my-payment-information">Does Blot store my payment information?</h2>
<p>No, your payment information never touches Blot's servers. I use <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to process subscription payments. Blot stores Stripe tokens which can be used to initiate subscription payments. Read more about <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security">Stripe's security</a> on their website.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-accept-paypalbitcoincash">Do you accept PayPal/Bitcoin/Cash?</h2>
<p>Yes, <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and weâ€™ll sort something out.</p>
<h2 id="does-blot-support-services-other-than-dropbox">Does Blot support services other than Dropbox?</h2>
<p>Not at the moment. However, I plan to eventually add support for other ways to sync your folder: Git, FTP, GitHub, Google Drive etc.</p>
<h2 id="can-blot-access-all-the-files-in-my-dropbox">Can Blot access all the files in my Dropbox?</h2>
<p>No, Blot only has access to a single folder, the one which contains your blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="will-my-dropbox-bandwidth-usage-be-affected-by-my-blog">Will my Dropbox bandwidth usage be affected by my blog?</h2>
<p>Dropbox's bandwidth cap won't affect your blog. Blog posts in your Dropbox are converted into HTML and stored on Blot's servers.</p>
<h2 id="does-my-subscription-renew-automatically">Does my subscription renew automatically?</h2>
<p>Yes. I'll email you a week before your subscription is renewed to give you have time to cancel or update your billing information. I hate sneaky unwanted recurring payments as much as you do.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-cancel-my-subscription">How do I cancel my subscription?</h2>
<p>You can cancel your subscription with a single click on the <a href="/account">account page</a>. You can choose to disable your blog immediately, or wait until the end of your current subscription period.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-delete-my-account">Can I delete my account?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can <a href="/account/disable-account">delete your account</a> on the dashboard.</p>
