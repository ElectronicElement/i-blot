<p>Blot charges an annual fee. You’ll be billed when you first create a site, and in yearly increments after. You can host as many sites as you like from the same account, (and the same Dropbox folder).</p>
<p>Your payment information does not touch Blot’s servers. Blot uses <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to process subscription payments. You can read more about <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security">Stripe’s security</a> on their website.</p>
<h2>
Does Blot support any alternatives to Dropbox?
</h2>
<p>
Not at the moment. However, I plan to eventually add support Git, FTP, GitHub and Google Drive. Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if there’s a service you’d like me to support.
</p>
<h2>
Does Blot have a bandwidth or storage limit?
</h2>
<p>
No, there’s no hard bandwidth or storage limit. However, if you use more than 1TB of bandwidth + storage combined per year, I will ask you to pay enough to meet the cost of hosting your site, or help you set up Blot on your own server.

<h2 id="can-blot-access-all-the-files-in-my-dropbox">Can Blot access all the files in my Dropbox?</h2>
<p>No, not by default. Blot only has access to a single folder in your Dropbox. However, you can grant Blot <a href="/clients/dropbox">full access to your folder</a>. You should only do this if you want to move your site’s folder elsewhere, or share it with other people who use Dropbox.</p>
<h2 id="does-blot-use-up-my-dropbox-bandwidth">Does Blot use up my Dropbox bandwidth?</h2>
<p>No, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/banned-links">Dropbox’s traffic limits</a> do not apply to Blot. This is because Blot first transfers the contents of your folder to its server before delivering it to your readers.</p>
<h2 id="does-my-subscription-renew-automatically">Does my subscription renew automatically?</h2>
<p>Yes. I will email you one week before your subscription is renewed to give you time to cancel or update your billing information. I hate sneaky unwanted recurring bills as much as you do.</p>
<h2 id="canceling-your-subscription">Canceling your subscription</h2>
<p>You can cancel your subscription on the <a href="/account">account page</a>. You can choose to disable your account immediately, or wait until the end of your current subscription period. You can also permanently <a href="/account/disable-account">delete your account</a>.</p>
