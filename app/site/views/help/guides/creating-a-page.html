  <h1>Creating a page</h1> 
  
  <p>The easiest way to create a page is to make a new folder called <code class="folder">Pages</code> and put a file inside which contains the page's content:</p>
</div>

  <pre class="file"><code># About

If this file is in a folder called 'Pages', Blot will add it to your blog's menu instead of turning into a post. You'll have an about page!</code></pre>

<div class="measure">

<h2>Using metadata</h2> 
<p>If you'd rather, you can use a <a href="/help#metadata">post's metadata</a> to create a page:</p>

</div>

<pre class="file"><code>Page: yes
Menu: no

Since this file's metadata contains 'Page: yes', Blot will turn this file into a page even if it isn't inside a folder called 'Pages'. And since this file's metadata contains 'Menu: no', it will not appear on your blog's menu.</code></pre><br>
