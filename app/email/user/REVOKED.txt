Blot is having trouble syncing with your Dropbox

Hi {{name}},

Blot just tried and failed to sync your blog posts from Dropbox.

Fixing this is super simple â€“ all you have to do is [log in]({{site}}/account/logout?redirect=/auth) to Blot.

When you've done that Blot will be able to sync your blog posts again! Feel free to reply to this email if you have any questions.

Best, David
