Blot will renew your subscription next week

Hi {{name}}!

This is just a quick email to let you know that [Blot]({{site}}) will renew your subscription in a week’s time.

Over the past year I've added [new themes and features](http://news.blot.im). I've written more about these on [my blog](http://news.blot.im).

If your payment information has changed in the last year, please [update your billing information]({{site}}/update-billing) to avoid any problems renewing your subscription.

If you want to close your account, please [cancel]({{site}}/cancel) your subscription in the next seven days to avoid an unwanted charge.

Please don’t hesitate to reply to this email if you have any questions.

Best, David
