Does Cloudfront use blot.im as host when requesting origin or blot.im? 
- It would be nice ot keep blotcdn.com as host so we could remove cloudfront and everything would still work.
- Will we need to generate an SSL cert for blotcdn.com

Add some lines to nginx configuration to handle delivery of static files too, but pass requests to node if otherwise.
