Archive template
----------------

Designed for a collection of quotes (text files), links (weblocs) and images. Primarily for images. Optimized for tag folders and tagging in general.

A few decisions to make:

Fixed floating navigation or part of page? I decided on part of page.

Respect the images. Don't crop them. don't put stuff on top of them. Give them space.

Type

I want to use Chester Jenkins' Cooper Hewitt font and this seems appropriate. Cooper Hewitt uses it for their online archive too so it seems like an appropriate choice.

Add link on entry page to the archives page at point where the entry is. One of the things I like about libraries is searching for a book, then looking at the adjacent books on the shelf. I want to be able to reproduce that experience. Or maybe put the next and previous posts at the bottom of the page?

For the archives page, I very much like the filtering on Anish Kapoor's website:
http://anishkapoor.com/#thought-experiment

I very much like the menu hamburger button. Perhaps use this on mobile? http://ktown92.com/index

I also very much like the density of the columns on this page: https://www.experimentaljetset.nl/
They seem perfectly sized. Is it possible to pull this layout off using css? It looks like it. Do this!

I also like this layout for the archives page, particularly the link and date treatment:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Perhaps put the list of tags on the right side and do something similar
