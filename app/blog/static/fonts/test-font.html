		<h1>Bookbinding</h1>
		<p>
			When the sheets of books that have to be rebound have been carelessly
			folded, a certain amount of readjustment is often advisable, especially in
			cases where the book has not been previously cut. The title-page and the
			half-title, when found to be out of square, should nearly always be put
			straight. The folding of the whole book may be corrected by taking each
			pair of leaves and holding them up to the light and adjusting the fold so
			that the print on one leaf comes exactly over the print on the[52] other,
			and creasing the fold to make them stay in that position. With a pair of
			dividers (fig. 6) set to the height of the shortest top margin, points the
			same distance above the headline of the other leaves can be made. Then
			against a carpenter’s square, adjusted to the back of the fold, the head
			of one pair of leaves at a time can be cut square (see fig. 7). If the
			book has been previously cut this process is apt to throw the leaves so
			far out of their original position as to make them unduly uneven.
		</p>
		<p>
			Accurate folding is impossible if the “register” of the printing is bad,
			that is to say, if the print on the back of a leaf does not lie exactly
			over that on the front.
		</p>
		<p>
			Crooked plates should usually be made straight by judicious trimming of
			the margins. It is better to leave a plate short at[53] tail or fore-edge
			than to leave it out of square.
		</p>
		<h2>Knocking out joints</h2>
		<p>
			The old “joints” must be knocked out of the sections of books that have
			been previously backed. To do this, one or two sections at a time are held
			firmly in the left hand, and well hammered on the knocking-down iron fixed
			into the lying press. It is important that the hammer face should fall
			exactly squarely upon the paper, or it may cut pieces out. The
			knocking-down iron should be covered with a piece of paper, and the hammer
			face must be perfectly clean, or the sheets may be soiled.
