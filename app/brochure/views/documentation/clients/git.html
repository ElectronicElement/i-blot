<h1>Git</h1>

<p>You can synchronize your blog's folder with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.</p>
<p>You can also switch seamlessly to <a href="/documentation/clients">another client</a> at any point.</p>

<h2>Setting up Git</h2>

<p>When you configure your blog with the git client on the dashboard, Blot will provide a repository URL, username and password.</p>

<pre>git clone https://blot.im/url-to-your-repository.git</pre>

<p>Blot uses the master branch of your repository to generate your blog. To update your blog, commit the changes you make and push. Note that you will need to push your changes for your <a href="/publishings/drafts">Drafts</a> to update.</p>

<h2>Using an existing Git repository</h2>

<p>You can use an existing git repostory. Set its remote URL to Blot's repository endpoint:</p>

<pre>git remote set-url origin https://blot.im/url-to-your-repository.git</pre>

<p>The next time you push, you will need to use the force flag:</p>

<pre>git push --force</pre>


<h2>Sharing your folder on GitHub</h2>

<p>Recent versions of git support multiple remote URLs. This means you can use the same repository on Blot and GitHub. If you have an existing repository on GitHub, you can add Blot's endpoint:</p>

<pre>git remote set-url --add --push origin https://blot.im/url-to-your-repository.git</pre>

<p>The next time you push, you will need to use the force flag to ensure the changes go through on Blot:</p>

<pre>git push --force</pre>
