<h1>Clients</h1>

<p>You can synchronize your blog's folder with any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/documentation/clients/dropbox">Dropbox</a></li>
  <li><a href="/documentation/clients/git">Git</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can switch seamlessly between clients at any point.</p>

<p>Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if there's a client you'd like me to add. Blot can theoretically support any system which is able to synchronize a folder over the internet. I'll be working on supporting FTP next, then Google Drive and OneDrive.</p>
