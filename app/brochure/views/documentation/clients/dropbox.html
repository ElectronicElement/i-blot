<h2>Can Blot access all the files in my Dropbox?</h2>

<p>
  Blot only requests access to your blog’s folder in your Dropbox by default. However, you can choose to grant Blot <a href="/clients/dropbox">special access to your entire Dropbox</a>. You should only do this if you want to move your blog’s folder, or share it with other people who use Dropbox.
