<h1>Images</h1>

<p>An image in your blog’s folder becomes its own <a href="{{base}}/publishing/posts">blog post</a> by default. However, files and fold­ers whose name starts with an un­der­score are ig­nored. Ignored ﬁles don’t be­come blog posts them­selves but they can be em­bed­ded in other posts.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to insert an image into a blog post. The best way will depend on the type of file you’d like to use to create the post.</p>

<h2>Using a Word Document</h2>
<p>Just drag and drop the image into the Word Document.</p>

<h2>Using a text file</h2>
<p>You can use <a href="/formatting">Markdown</a> to embed an image in your post:</p>

<background><pre class="text with-chrome" title="Post.txt"><code>Here’s how to embed an image in your folder:

![Image title](/path/to/the/_image.jpg)

Absolute paths are resolved with your blog’s folder as root directory. Relative paths are resolved from the location of this file. Paths are case-insensitive. 

You can also embed an image that’s already on the internet:

![Image title](https://url.of/the/image.jpg)
