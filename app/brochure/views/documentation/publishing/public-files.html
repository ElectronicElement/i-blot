<h1>Public files</h1>
<p>All the files in your blog’s folder are public and can be accessed by your readers. This is useful if you want to <a href="{{{base}}}/publishing/images">embed an image</a> in your blog posts or distribute files. For example, let’s say this is your blog’s folder:</p>

<background><pre class="folder" title="Your blog"><code>Files
  Archive.zip
  index.html
Posts


</code></pre>
</background>

<p>Your readers can download&nbsp;<code class="file zip">&nbsp;Archive.zip&nbsp;</code>if they visit <em>/files/archive.zip</em> on your blog. Blot also serves index files. Your readers will see&nbsp;<code class="file html">&nbsp;index.html</code>&nbsp;if they visit <em>/files</em>. Paths to files are case-insensitive.</p>
