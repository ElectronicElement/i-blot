<p>Blot turns a folder into a blog. Text and Markdown ﬁles, Word Documents, im­ages, book­marks and HTML in your folder be­come blog posts.</p>

<p>You can organize the files in your folder to suit you and your blog. Create subfolders if you like, or don't. You can always re-organize your folder as you add files.</p>

<background><pre class="folder" title="Your blog"><code>Drafts
Pages
Posts
  Apple.txt
  Bannana.txt
  Cherry.txt


</code>
    </pre>

<p>You can synchronize your folder with <a href="{{{base}}}/clients/dropbox">Dropbox</a> or <a href="{{{base}}}/clients/git">Git</a>. All Blot needs is a folder.</p>


<p>Because Blot is file and folder based, you can use your own text-editor. Blot tries to get out of the way.</p>
