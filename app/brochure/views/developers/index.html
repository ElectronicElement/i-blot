<h1>Developer's guide</h1>

<p>Blot's template system offers you, the developer, control over every line of HTML, CSS and JavaScript delivered to your readers. </p>

<p>Here you’ll find a guide to developing templates for Blot. You will need a working knowledge of HTML and CSS. Blot's templates will be familiar to those who have developed for other platforms.
</p>

<p>If you’d like to hire a developer or designer to create a template for you, <a href="/developers/support">contact me</a>. I'll put you in touch with professionals who are familiar with Blot's templating system.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>You can <a href="/theme/new">create a new template</a> on the <a href="/theme">theme page</a> of your blog’s dashboard. You can make changes to a template using the online editor, or you can sync the template’s source files to your blog’s folder and edit them locally. </p>

<p>To familiarize yourself with Blot's templates I recommend cloning an existing template on the dashboard and looking through its source code. All seven of Blot’s included templates are <a href="https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/blob/master/license.txt">dedicated to the public domain</a> so you can modify and share them freely. </p>

</p>

<h2>Template files</h2>
<p>Blot’s templates will be familiar to those who have worked with other blogging platforms. They are written in <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a> and consist of tags which look like <code>\{{this}}</code>. These tags are replaced with the data generated by Blot when the template is rendered.</p>
