<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>You can <a href="/theme/new">create a new template</a> on the your blog’s dashboard. You can make changes to a template using the online editor, or you can sync the template’s source files to your blog’s folder and edit them directly. All of Blot’s templates are <a href="https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/blob/master/license.txt">dedicated to the public domain</a> so you can modify and share them freely.</p>


<h2>How Blot works</h2>

<p>Behind all the fan-fare, Blot is a static file server. It serves the contents of your folder to your readers. Above the static file server is Blot's template system, which lets you do cool things with the list of entries Blot generates from your folder</p>

<h2>Rendering templates</h2>

<p>Blot’s templates will be familiar to those who have worked with other blogging platforms. They are written in <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a> and consist of tags which look like <code>\{{this}}</code>. These tags are replaced with the data generated by Blot when the template is rendered.</p>
