<h1>Drafts</h1>

<p>Files in a folder called ‘Drafts’ are not published. Instead, Blot creates a preview file which updates as you make changes to your draft. </p>

<h2>Sharing drafts</h2>

<p>You can share the preview file with others. Preview files work on other computers that are connected to the internet. You can also get a public URL to a draft on your blog's dashboard.</p>
