To add a new site, append a line to ./sites.txt in the existing format. Then add an avatar inside ./avatars with the corresponding hostname as filename. e.g. add this to the end of sites.txt

example.com John Doe, is a farmer from Sicily

and then add 'example.com.png' to /avatars to ensure there's a favicon to show on the homepage. When the server starts, Blot will build the featured sites.
