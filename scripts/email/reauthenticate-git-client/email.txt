Git client re-authentication required

I'm writing because one of your blogs on [Blot](https://blot.im) uses the Git client. I recently changed the way git authenticates with Blot. Instead of your blog's username, the git client now uses your account's email address. This resolves a bug for users who manage multiple blogs with the git client.

When you next push, your existing credentials will fail. Please use these credentials instead:

Username: {{email}}
Password: [View your token](https://blot.im/log-in?then=/settings/client/git)

If you have any questions, please reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
