Re-authentication required with your git client

I'm writing because one of your blogs uses [Blot](https://blot.im)'s Git client. I recently changed the way this client authenticates. Instead of your blog's username, the git client now uses your account's email address. This was neccessary to fix a bug for people who manage multiple blogs with git.

When you next push, your existing credentials will fail. Please use these credentials instead:

Username: {{email}}
Password: [View your token](https://blot.im/log-in?then=/settings/client/git)

If you have any questions, please reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
