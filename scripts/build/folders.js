// This script generates demonstration blogs from the 
// folders inside app/folders. These blogs are useful
// for showing templates and explaining how Blot works
// in the docs. This script will create a blog for each
// folder e.g. one with the username 'bjorn' for 
// app/folders/bjorn

// It will configure the blog to use a local client
// pointing to the corresponding folders so that future
// changes apply immediately on the server.
