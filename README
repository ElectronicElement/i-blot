I recommend you wait until I write a setup guide before attempting to run Blot on your own server.

The code is contained in /app. Start Blot like this:

  node app

Blot creates a subdirectory 'blogs' in this directory. Inside it will create a folder for each blog.

My distant goal for the project would be for you, the self-hoster, to be able to do something like this:

  npm install blot -g
  blot /path/to/folder

or something like this:

  var blot = require('blot');
  var blog = blot('/path/to/folder');

  blog.listen(8080);

Your blog would be built each time the process started and stored in memory. All you'd need to install would be node.js. This is a long way off but I will get there eventually! At the moment, Blot depends on redis, pandoc and nginx and various non-JavaScript tools for file compression.

Eventually I will sell Blot to self-hosters. It will be priced reasonably, with an option to pay for support. I like how Kirby does it.
