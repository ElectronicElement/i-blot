I strongly advise you not to try and install Blot for the moment. Soon I will write a guide explaining how. 

Eventually I will sell a 'license' to self-hosters who do *not* have a Blot subscription. It will be priced similarly to Kirby. This will help cover the cost of providing support and maintenance.
