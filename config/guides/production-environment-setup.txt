Set up
------

Blot depends on a file like environment.sh located at the path "/etc/blot/environment.sh". You must copy the template in this directory there and fill it out. The [upstart job](./upstart/blot.conf) for Blot depends on this.

Then make sure you make all the contents of scripts/production executable:

```shell
chmod +x scripts/production/start_blot.sh
```
